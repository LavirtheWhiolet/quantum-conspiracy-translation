GLECKLER: Hi everyone. I'm Arthur Gleckler
and I'm happy to introduce Dr. Ron Garret

3
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:32,088
here, who's going to be speaking about quantum
mechanics today. He's a former Googler from

4
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:37,064
the very early days of the company, around
2000. He was the lead engineer on the first

5
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:43,037
release of AdWords and the original author
of the Google translation console. He also

6
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:48,041
wrote the first billing system that Google
used. Also, for many years, he worked at the

7
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,037
NASA Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, specializing
in AI and robotics. I'm hoping to convince

8
00:00:53,076 --> 00:00:59,079
him to come back and talk about his experiences,
debugging spacecraft 250 million miles from

9
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:06,059
the earth. Here's Ron.
>> GARRET: Thanks. So I'm told that my abstract

10
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:14,056
caused a little bit of a kerfuffle so let
me start out with a couple of disclaimers

11
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:20,025
upfront to kind of manage expectations. The
title of the talk was intended to be tongue-in-cheek.

12
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:25,016
There is no actual conspiracy, at least, as
far as I know but there is a fairly big disconnect

13
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:30,019
between what you read about quantum mechanics
in the popular press and what the actual underlying

14
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:35,027
truth is, and that's what this talk is about.
I am not a physicist. Do we have any actual

15
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:42,095
physicists in the crowd? Oh, boy, okay. You
can make sure you keep me honest. I'm a software

16
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:50,451
engineer. I came upon this about actually
20 years ago when I read an article in Scientific

17
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:55,003
American and I thought, "This can't possibly
be right." And it took me 10 years to finally

18
00:01:55,074 --> 00:02:01,419
find a physicist at Caltech who could explain
to me why in fact it wasn't right and at that

19
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,971
point, everything just kind of clicked and
quantum mechanics made a lot more sense to

20
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:08,239
me than it did before. And that's what this
talk is about. It's about--it's about a different

21
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:15,128
way to think about QM that hasn't gotten very
much attention and dispels this idea that

22
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:23,079
quantum mechanics is sort of intractably weird.
Somebody has said to me once that quantum

23
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:28,169
mechanics obeys the law of conservation of
weirdness. And to a certain extent, that is

24
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:33,521
true. There is a certain amount of--quantum
mechanics extracts a toll on your intuition

25
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:38,629
and some of that will never go away. But I
don't think that quantum mechanics needs to

26
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:44,001
be fundamentally any more incomprehensible
than, say, relativity which most technical

27
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,099
people seem to have no trouble wrapping their
brains around nowadays. So with that sort

28
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,097
of expectation management out of the way,
I want to start out by inviting you to think

29
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:00,001
about the question, "What does it mean to
'measure' something?" So, imagine that we're

30
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:07,180
sitting here doing some experiment. We have
some system--let me grab a pointer--that we

31
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:12,047
want to measure some property of it so we
have some, you know, sensor here like a camera,

32
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:16,979
and it gathers some data and we feed it to
a computer, and that data shall pop up from

33
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,671
the screen, and we look at that with our eyes,
and we form some mental image in our head,

34
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,669
and how do we know that this mental image
that we form in our head actually corresponds

35
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:32,491
to underlying physical reality? Well, one
indication that we have of this is that we

36
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:37,003
can do experiments more than once and observe
that we get consistent results. So, for example,

37
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:39,009
what color is this?
>> Green.

38
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:46,219
>> GARRET: Green, yes. So we can observe through
our common everyday experience that the results

39
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:54,241
of measurements are consistent across space
and time. And, I mean, this is really a very

40
00:03:54,091 --> 00:04:01,035
reliable aspect of our universe, but it's
actually a very deep mystery why this is so.

41
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:05,039
And Einstein famously said that, "The most
incomprehensible thing about the universe

42
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:10,088
is that it is comprehensible." We can actually
do experiments and get results that are consistent

43
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:16,081
across space and time and we don't really
know why that, any inherent reason, why that

44
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:22,059
should be the case. Now, there is one very
plausible sounding explanation of why this

45
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:26,098
is the case, and that is that the results
of these measurements are actually an accurate

46
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:31,009
reflection of some underlying metaphysical
reality. That reality, that there really is

47
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:37,041
a universe out there and when we measure it,
we're getting back actual information about

48
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:41,068
that underlying physical reality. And that
is the reason why these measurements are consistent

49
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:48,068
because reality sees to it that that's the
case. Well, it turns out that we can demonstrate

50
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:55,288
that that's not true. I'm about to lead you
down a rabbit hole but my purpose in leading

51
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:59,004
you down this rabbit hole is to do it in such
a way that you can find your way back out

52
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:03,009
again. So I'm going to do it very carefully,
step by step, and tell you in advance where

53
00:05:03,022 --> 00:05:08,094
we're going. I'm going to start out by reviewing
the usual QM story. What you will read if

54
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:14,016
you go to a popular account of quantum mechanics
that you read, you know, pick up at Amazon

55
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:21,314
or a bookstore or read about it in Wired or
whatever. I'll then show you how that story

56
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:27,016
can't possibly be true, because if that story
were true, it would lead to a violation of

57
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:31,019
relativity, in particular, it would lead to
faster-than-light communication. And it doesn't

58
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:35,038
do this in the usual way that most people
think that it leads to faster-than-light communication,

59
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:39,094
it does it in a more subtle way that really
hasn't gotten a lot of attention. So you physicists

60
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:46,339
in the room, bear with me. Then, I'm going
to walk you through some of the actual underlying

61
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:53,058
mathematics of quantum mechanics, in a way
that is accessible to anyone who knows--can

62
00:05:53,001 --> 00:06:00,353
do basic algebra and knows what algorithm
is. And finally, tell a new story based on

63
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:06,002
our understanding of what the underlying mathematics
actually says about what's really going on

64
00:06:06,044 --> 00:06:13,366
and hopefully we'll achieve enlightenment
at the end of that. So, is there anybody here

65
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:18,019
who has not heard of the two-slit experiment?
All right, good. I will just blast through

66
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:25,851
this very quickly. So, we have a--this is--you
have a laser that shines through two-slits,

67
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:32,044
and you get an interference pattern that shows
that light is a wave and can interfere with

68
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:39,392
itself like any other wave. And there are
two strange things about this. If you look

69
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:46,033
at the results of this experiment with very
low intensity light, what you find is, and

70
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:53,089
this isn't showing up very well, but this
top image here shows just some dots scattered

71
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:57,003
randomly. And then dots get denser and denser
and denser until down here at the bottom you

72
00:06:57,055 --> 00:07:01,067
have a dense enough pattern of dots that you
can start to see this interference pattern

73
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:08,421
start to emerge. And this is an actual photograph
of laser light going through a single slit

74
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:13,082
and going through two slits. And you can see
this interference pattern here, this is actual,

75
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:17,094
an actual photograph of the same experiment,
this particular one happened to be done with

76
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:24,437
electrons but the underlying physics is the
same. And the--the thing to notice here is

77
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:29,071
that the total amount of light that you get
in this pattern when there are two slits is

78
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:34,083
brighter than the overall amount of light
that you get with one slit which is what you

79
00:07:34,028 --> 00:07:40,109
would expect but that there are some places
here where you have these dark bands that

80
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,421
were bright up here when you only had one
slit. And this is the interesting part that

81
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:49,065
you want to kind of focus your attention on
because what this means is that there's a

82
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:54,099
spot here where light was shining and then
you open up an extra path for light to get

83
00:07:54,045 --> 00:08:01,474
to the screen and that spot goes dark. And
that is the manifestation of interference.

84
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:06,092
But the strange thing about it is that this
is not a continuous phenomenon, it's an accumulation

85
00:08:06,062 --> 00:08:13,098
of all these particles. Now, I can actually--I
used to think that this was a fairly subtle

86
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:18,097
experiment that you need a specialized equipment
to conduct this experiment. It turns out it's

87
00:08:18,057 --> 00:08:23,077
not true, you can actually do this experiment
yourself. These are some pencil leads that

88
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:29,042
I've taped together with scotch tape and this
is an ordinary laser pointer. And if I pass

89
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,079
these, and there's just some very narrow gaps
between these leads, so you can actually see

90
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,221
this happen if I pass the leads in front of
this pointer, you can see the light start

91
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:44,091
to spread out. And if you're close enough,
you can actually see the interference bands.

92
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:48,082
I don't think you can see it in the back.
But if you're interested, after the talk,

93
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:51,063
come up, I'll give you a closer look at it.
You can actually see the interference pattern.

94
00:08:51,042 --> 00:08:56,057
The point here is that this is not a subtle
phenomenon and it's not something that you

95
00:08:56,099 --> 00:09:03,044
need expensive equipment to reproduce. This
is an everyday experience for modern humans,

96
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:10,543
at least. Okay, so this is not yet intractably
weird, because there are all kinds of explanations

97
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:16,034
that we can postulate about how this might
be happening. So, for example, photons and

98
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:20,032
electrons might be real particles that have
real locations and velocities like our intuitions

99
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:26,079
about particles that might be pushed around
by some kind of underlying wave. And--oh,

100
00:09:26,044 --> 00:09:33,566
I forgot to mention--whoops--the location
where these particles accumulate is random,

101
00:09:33,096 --> 00:09:40,042
there's no known way to predict other than
statistically where these particles are going

102
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:47,087
to end up on the screen. So, the randomness
might just be due to some underlying real

103
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:52,088
physical property that we just don't know
how to measure. But it turns out we can eliminate

104
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:57,024
this possibility as well. And the way we do
that is by asking--by trying to track the

105
00:09:57,037 --> 00:10:03,007
path of a particle and ask with--on its way
to the screen, on its way to producing this

106
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:07,014
interference pattern, which of these two slits
did it go through? And we could do that. We

107
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:12,064
can add detectors to the slits and we can
measure which of the two slits a particle

108
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:16,009
went through. But it turns out that when we
do that the interference pattern goes away

109
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:23,616
and the phenomenon that we were trying to
get a better grip on has changed. And it turns

110
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:29,039
out that this is an inherent feature of quantum
mechanics, that any modification that we make

111
00:10:29,006 --> 00:10:35,027
to this experiment that allows us to determine,
even in principle, which of these slits this

112
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:42,635
particle went through destroys the interference.
This is the famous wave particle duality,

113
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,569
any modification that allows us to determine
even in principle--yeah?

114
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,551
>> You ask people in the VC to mute their
mics so...

115
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:59,004
>> GARRET: So, I've been asked to ask the
people on the VC to mute their mics, did I

116
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:06,659
get that right? Okay. Okay, anyway, so the
conclusion from this observation is that something

117
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:13,003
has to be--something has to be at both slits
in order to produce interference. And the

118
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:18,071
reason we know that is because we don't actually
need both of these detectors, one of them

119
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:24,007
is enough, because if we have one detector
and it fails to register that we know the

120
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:29,019
particle went through the other slit. Now,
that particle going through the other slit,

121
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:34,017
it never interacted with anything, the particle
never interacted with anything, but because

122
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:38,006
it allows us to know where the particle was
even though we didn't actually measure it,

123
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:43,016
that's enough to destroy the interference
and so this particle that's over here must

124
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:46,044
somehow have known that we were looking over
here even though the particle itself wasn't

125
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:52,005
there. So, something must have been there
to be able to tell that we had a detector

126
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:59,072
here, but we don't know what that is. Now,
it turns out, this is again, this is a universal

127
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:04,094
property of quantum mechanics. It holds for
any kind of particle--in practice, that means

128
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:09,719
photons and electrons because that's all there
is in this universe unless you start getting

129
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,081
into nuclear physics. And any kind of measurement,
and any kind two-slit experiment, any experiment

130
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,211
where you provide two different paths for
the particle to potentially go down and bring

131
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:23,016
it back together without knowing which way
it actually went will produce interference

132
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:26,002
and any modification that you make that lets
you figure you out where it went will destroy

133
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:32,002
that interference. Now, this is still not
intractably weird because we can still tell

134
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:37,469
a reasonable story about why this might happen.
So, maybe measurement does something to this

135
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,911
system. These are after all very small particles
and very delicate systems and so maybe it's

136
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:45,719
just physically impossible to make a measurement
without disturbing the system in a way that

137
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,056
is the cause of the destruction of this interference.
Maybe the wave function collapses and becomes

138
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,771
a particle somehow, this is the famous Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics. But it

139
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:04,076
turns out that we can rule out that possibility
as well. And the way we rule out that possibility

140
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:11,784
is by asking, "How and when does this collapse,
this purported collapse, happen?" Collapse

141
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:17,229
has a number of features that ought to make
us very suspicious of it just at priority

142
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:23,041
without even doing any experiments. It's a
discontinuous and nonreversible phenomenon

143
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:27,075
that once you know that a particle has gone
through one slit or the other, you can't go

144
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,079
roll back time and undo that. And if you look
at the mathematics of quantum mechanics, which

145
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:39,009
we'll get to later, there's nothing in the
math that's discontinuous. And more than that,

146
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:46,819
all the math is actually time reversible so
we can make a--hypothesize that this collapse

147
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:52,035
happens, but this is fundamentally at odds
with the mathematics of what quantum mechanics--of

148
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:56,049
how quantum mechanic says that our universe
works. So we can actually do better than that.

149
00:13:56,082 --> 00:14:03,836
We can actually do an experiment to show that
collapse, if it happens, is a much subtler

150
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:11,844
phenomenon than it would've first appear and
this is the famous--this is the quantum mystery

151
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:15,016
number two, the famous quantum eraser. Now,
I--this is a two-slit experiment that I have

152
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:21,075
now reduced to something more abstract. So
we have some particle source, this can be

153
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:27,018
photons or electrons. We have some abstract
way of splitting up particles so that it has

154
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:34,867
two different paths to go down and some abstract
way of recombining that particle so that both

155
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:38,063
of those paths end up in the same place so
that we get interference. And here notionally,

156
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:45,084
we have one detector at one of these dark
fringes and another one at a bright fringe

157
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:51,072
so that if we introduce some kind of an abstract
measurement on one of these branches then

158
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:58,891
the interference pattern fusses out, that
we now have the path, the amount of light,

159
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,301
in each detector. So now we don't have fringes
anymore, we have the spread-out pattern that

160
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:09,085
we saw and the single slit version of the
experiment. Like I said, there are lots of

161
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:14,005
different ways that you can do this--actually,
let me go on to the next one. So it turns

162
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:20,097
out that you can erase this, that there are
physical ways that if this measurement, certain

163
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:25,031
kinds of proto measurements, that you can
do here, you can then go back and erase after

164
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:32,829
the fact and restore the interference. And
here's a concrete example of that. If we depolarize

165
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,087
light and--I'm actually going to show you
this in just a second, so bear with me if

166
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,361
you don't understand what I'm about to say,
you use polarized light and you do the measurement

167
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:46,519
by rotating that light 90 degrees and then
erase it by filtering it 45 degrees, that

168
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:51,891
is an actual concrete example of a quantum
eraser. And I can't show you the interference

169
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:58,169
part of it but I can show you the erasure
part. So what I have here is some Polaroid

170
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:03,081
film, this is the same stuff that you find
in polarized sunglasses. And, I first want

171
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:10,963
to convince you, has anyone not played with
this stuff before? Okay, so again, real quick.

172
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:16,321
If the--if the axis of the film are aligned
then you can see through it. Can everybody

173
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:22,739
see through this? And if I rotate it at 90
degrees then you can't see through it anymore

174
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,701
and that effect is independent of the absolute
orientation of the film so the light that's

175
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:33,007
going through to your eyes starts at unpolarized
over here, it gets--passes through this film

176
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:39,008
and becomes polarized, let's say in this direction,
and I can demonstrate then that it has become

177
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:45,095
polarized in that direction by filtering it
out using a filter at 90 degrees. And there's

178
00:16:45,076 --> 00:16:51,069
also this cool adjunct to the experiment that
you can do by adding a filter at 45 degrees.

179
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:54,199
If you put it in front or behind, nothing
happens which is pretty much what you--what

180
00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:01,1014
you'd expect. But if you slide this in between,
then suddenly you can see through it again.

181
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:08,1021
Pretty cool, huh? And the reason for that
is because if you start out with polarized

182
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:13,209
light and you filter it at 45 degrees then
some of it gets through and it's now polarized

183
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,671
in this direction. And now I can do the same
operation again, which is now the relative

184
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:23,025
orientation of these two are 45 degrees so
some of it gets through again. But that's

185
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:30,1043
not what I want to show you, that's not the
cool part. Cool part is this stuff. This is

186
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:36,039
what they didn't show you, what they didn't
show you in high school. This film is actually

187
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:43,1056
a polarization rotator. If I'd stick this
in here, I can actually take this light that's

188
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,084
polarizing this direction, I can rotate it
to 90 degrees that it's polarizing the same

189
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:56,049
direction as this film. And the thing to notice
here is that the apparent brightness here

190
00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:01,054
in the center is the same as it is up here.
There's before, if we did the high school

191
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:08,1081
version of the experiment--whoops--you've
gotten quite a bit of loss. So, I really can take--I can take light and

192
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:27,1100
I can polarize it and I can take that polarized
light and I can rotate it by 90 degrees and

193
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:31,269
so I can create two different paths so I can
tell which way the light went through. I can

194
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:34,024
tell whether the light is going through here
or whether the light is going through here.

195
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:41,069
Actually, let me back up a step. My claim
is, without this filter, it's a little hard.

196
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,071
My claim is that the light that's coming out
of here is different than the light that's

197
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:49,029
coming out of here, so I can tell which way
it went. And the way that I can demonstrate

198
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,038
that to you is with this measurement apparatus
that lets me filter out this light and tell

199
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:01,098
which way it went. So this is a measurement.
This should collapse the wave function according

200
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:08,1141
to the Copenhagen interpretation. But I can
undo this, and the way I undo it is by filtering

201
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:14,003
at 45 degrees. And now, I have to ask you
for a little bit of suspension of disbelief

202
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,033
because this is not high precision optical
equipment and my angles aren't aligned just

203
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:23,029
right. And if you look very closely, you will
actually be able to tell the difference between

204
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:30,1163
these two paths, but the difference is now
much less than it was before. See that? Oh,

205
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:37,951
I'm sorry. I didn't realize there are people
over there. Okay, I'll just show you all this

206
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:44,719
at close range afterwards. So there's a measurement.
There's an erasure of that measurement. The

207
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:51,1184
light is going this way so the--in time, the
erasure has to happen after the measurement.

208
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,076
And if I actually had a laser to shine through
this, I can demonstrate to you that the interference

209
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:02,1195
would go away and would come back. So again,
these are not subtle effects and they're not

210
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:09,581
effects that you necessarily need high precision
equipment to reproduce, it's an everyday experiment.

211
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:16,1209
This is $30 worth of polarizing film. So this
leaves us with the philosophical conundrum

212
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:26,1219
that is embodied by Schrodinger's cat. If
there's no collapse, then if we set up a radioactive

213
00:20:26,044 --> 00:20:31,609
source that triggers some kind of a mechanism
that will break a bottle of poison that will

214
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:36,094
kill a cat that's in a sealed box, can this--what
happens? Quantum mechanics says that this

215
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:43,057
cat isn't a quantum superposition of being
alive and dead which is intuitively absurd

216
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:50,1243
but as far as we can tell, that's really what
happens. So if that's not intractably weird

217
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:57,691
enough for you, this is the third quantum
mystery entanglement which is usually described

218
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:02,539
as sort of an ancillary phenomenon to all
these other mysteries. And, oh, yes. It's

219
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:08,027
sort of--oh, by the way, has everybody seen
this picture? Has anybody not seen this picture

220
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:14,411
before? Okay. This is what the production
of quantum entangled photons really looks

221
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:19,329
like. You take a--this is not--this is not
an actual photograph, this is a drawing. But

222
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,831
this is an actual photograph of the output
of one of these gadgets. There's an ultraviolet

223
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:28,006
laser that shines through a crystal of some
material called beta barium borate, details

224
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:33,039
don't matter, and this crystal has this interesting
property that it will absorb photons of ultraviolet

225
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:39,054
light and reemit them in--and that it'll kick
an electron up to an excited state, and then

226
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,096
that electron will drop back down to its ground
state and it will do it in two steps. And

227
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:48,039
so it will kick up in one step, down in two,
and in the process of coming back down, it

228
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:55,1308
will emit two photons instead of one so what
comes out of this system is visible light.

229
00:21:55,044 --> 00:22:01,589
And the photons always come out in pairs and
they come out in matched sets because of fundamental

230
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:08,1321
conservation laws. We have law--conservation
of energy and momentum and so--and electron--a

231
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:14,015
photon that, say, comes out over here is a
red, photon will be matched by one that comes

232
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:20,033
out over here as a blue photon, and the same
thing over here. And in the middle, you get

233
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:25,841
this band where you get photons that come
out at the same wavelength and it just matched

234
00:22:25,035 --> 00:22:29,319
in position so a photon over here will be
matched by one over here. And they'll also

235
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:36,1349
be matched in polarization as it turns out.
So this is the way it's depicted conceptually.

236
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:41,701
You have these ultraviolet lasers. It's called
a down convert--this crystal is called a down

237
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:47,209
converter, and you send these photons off
to opposite sides of the universe and what--and

238
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:53,022
then you measure some property out of them.
Let's say, we split them according to polarization

239
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,018
or position them in, it doesn't matter, any
quantum state variables, as long as you can

240
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,069
filter them that way and what you find is
that they're perfectly anti-correlated because

241
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:05,861
of the conservations laws. So if you get a
photon up here, on the right side of the experiment

242
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:09,539
at the upper detector, that will always be
matched by a photon over here on the left

243
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:16,1389
side of the experiment at the down detector.
An unfortunate artifact of the English language

244
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,681
that words "left" and "lower" both start with
a letter L so I'm going to switch back and

245
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:28,1401
forth between them. This is what the--what
Einstein famously called, "Spooky action at

246
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:36,1409
a distance." If you take this phenomenon,
this isn't controversial, this is an experimental--an

247
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:42,409
undeniable experimental result, this really
does happen, combine that with a fact if there

248
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:47,055
is no collapse with the wave function and
the inescapable conclusion seems to be that

249
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:52,007
as it was put in Wired as recently as last
June, that when an aspect of one photon's

250
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:58,009
quantum state is measured, the other photon
changes in response even when the two photons

251
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:03,018
are separated by large distances. And this
would seem to be impossible because it would

252
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,084
seem to violate relativity because it's an
instantaneous effect and we know that we can't

253
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:12,049
communicate information faster than light,
because if we could do that then we could

254
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:16,002
communicate information back within time and
that would cause all kinds of problems with

255
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,661
causality and just be a horrible mess. So
these instantaneous effects are supposed to

256
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:26,919
be impossible but there is one thing that
comes to save us and that is this quantum

257
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:33,1466
randomness. We don't actually have any control
over whether the photon on one side ends up

258
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:38,074
at the upper detector or the lower detector
and so we can't actually send information

259
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:43,851
up here to there, we know that if we see the
photon up on the upper detector over here,

260
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:49,899
then our counterpart across the universe must
have seen it at the lower detector over there

261
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:54,571
but we haven't transmitted any information
from A to B. And you can actually prove this

262
00:24:54,094 --> 00:25:01,869
mathematically that it's impossible to transmit
information using this phenomenon. But it

263
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:08,1501
turns out that the proof of the impossibility
has a loophole. So that is the end of step

264
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:16,004
one. I'm now going to on the step two and
show why the story that I've just told you

265
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:22,038
can't possibly be true. So let's summarize
and take stock. A split/combine experiment

266
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:28,001
produces interference. Any which-way measurement
destroys that interference, there's some which-way

267
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,088
that the proto measurements that we can go
back and erase after the fact and restore

268
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:39,1532
the interference and measurements on entangled
particles are perfectly anti-correlated. So

269
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:45,007
the quantum conspiracy is that all of these
things cannot possibly be true and here's

270
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:52,1545
why. So this is a thought experiment. This
experiment has not actually been done that,

271
00:25:53,309 --> 00:26:00,1553
again, with tongue slightly in cheek, I've
done the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Garret paradox,

272
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:07,1560
and it's two-slit experiments that are fed
by quantum entangled photons produced by one

273
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:12,641
of these down converter setups in the middle,
and I want you to consider the question of

274
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:19,1572
if we measure on the left, do we destroy the
interference on the right? So, if the answer

275
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:26,079
is yes, then we have faster-than-light communication
because this interference is a macroscopic

276
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:31,052
effect. It's really easy to see if you have
interference or not. You just look at it with

277
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,094
your eyes. You don't need any kind of delicate
detectors or anything so you just measure

278
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:41,076
over here and take measurement away, measure,
take the measurement away, and over there

279
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:44,018
on the other side of the universe, this interference
pattern will come and go and you can send

280
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,006
Morse code instantaneously. That's obviously
impossible, so the answer must be no. But

281
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:56,025
if the answer is no, then we know the position
of one particle but we have interference regardless

282
00:26:56,229 --> 00:27:02,471
and that contradicts the fundamental principle
of quantum mechanics, which is that we can't

283
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:09,1622
know the position of the particle and still
have it interfere. Now, this is not yet an

284
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:16,056
iron-clad argument. There is one other possibility
that I have not mentioned here. Can anybody

285
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:22,911
think of what it is? Any of the physicists
in the crowd? Oh, good. So, this one last

286
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:27,459
possibility, and that is that if there was
no interference to begin with. It might be

287
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:33,069
that entanglement sort of counts as one of
these subtle proto-measurements that destroys

288
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,591
the interference so we didn't have any interference
to begin with. But it turns out that doesn't

289
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:41,329
get us out of this faster-than-light conundrum
because, fine, if that's the case, then we

290
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:46,002
can still produce faster-than-light communications
by putting in a quantum eraser and destroy

291
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:49,077
the entanglement. Entanglement is a very--is
a very delicate property. Physicists work

292
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:55,017
very hard to produce it and maintain it. It's
very easy to destroy. So, just destroy the

293
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:58,034
entanglement and produce interference where
there was none before and, again, we have

294
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:05,1678
a faster-than-light signal-ly mechanism. Now,
that is a very compelling argument that the

295
00:28:05,007 --> 00:28:11,979
story that I have told you, the usual quantum
story is wrong. That argument is, in fact,

296
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,055
correct. The story that I have told up until
now is, in fact, wrong, and that's why.

297
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:22,042
>> You said this experiment hasn't been done,
why not?

298
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:27,084
>> GARRET: Because all physicists know what
the outcome will be. And I'm about--I'm about

299
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:31,056
to tell you what the outcome will be. And
by the time I finish telling you, you will

300
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:34,041
be convinced enough that the outcome is what
I tell you that it will be that you won't

301
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:39,069
need--feel the need to do the experiment either.
I promise you--hmm?

302
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,073
>> GLECKLER: Why don't you repeat the question.
>> GARRET: Oh, I'm sorry. The question was,

303
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,058
why hasn't this experiment been done. Yeah?
>> So the entanglement is about polarization,

304
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:52,1725
in which way it goes through a splitter, is
that about exactly the same polarization,

305
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:58,022
we know they're the same?
>> GARRET: That's right. So, I assuming here,

306
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:01,057
like I said, there are lots of different ways
that you can do the split-combine experiments.

307
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:04,082
You can use some thing called a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. You can use something called

308
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:08,048
a Stern-Gerlach device. You can, you know,
lots of different ways. When I talk about

309
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:11,055
polarization, the way that the splitting is
done is with the device called the polarizing

310
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:16,085
beam splitter, which is exactly like one of
these, except instead of just absorbing half

311
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,026
the photons and letting half the--half of
them go through, it reflects them. So it look

312
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:27,087
like a mirror, a half-silvered mirror, and
what comes out this direction is photons that

313
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,096
are polarized one direction and what gets
reflected at the other direction are photons

314
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:39,1772
that are polarized in the opposite direction.
Okay, so we are now in the depths of the rabbit

315
00:29:40,008 --> 00:29:47,939
hole and now, it's time to find our way back
out. We're going to do some math. Don't panic,

316
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:53,431
it will not be as bad as you think. This is
the mathematics of quantum mechanics right

317
00:29:53,045 --> 00:30:00,1793
here. This is the famous Schrodinger wave
equation. It's--this is the free variable

318
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:06,1800
here is this thing called psi. Psi is the
quantum wave function and it obeys the dynamics

319
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:11,529
of this partial differential equation, which
those of you who are proficient in partial

320
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:16,094
differential equations, will recognize as
a wave equation like any other equation that

321
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:22,281
describes waves, and that's why these particles
seem to propagate like wave because this is

322
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:29,1822
the map that describes how they propagate.
The point here is that these, the dynamics

323
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:36,1829
of this thing, are continuous and time-reversible.
All wave equations have continuous time-reversible

324
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:43,849
dynamics. And the second part of quantum mechanics
is that you take this quantum wave function,

325
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:49,025
which is a function of position and time and
is a complex number, you take the norm, the

326
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:53,013
magnitude of that complex number and square
it, and that gives you the probability of

327
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,096
measuring a particle at this position X at
a time T. That's really all you need to know

328
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:05,074
about the mathematics of quantum mechanics.
There are some things to note about this.

329
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:10,026
There is this distinction between the underlying
amplitudes, which are complex numbers, and

330
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:15,058
the probabilities, which are of where we find
these particles, which is the only thing that

331
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:21,096
we can measure which are real numbers. And
the reason that particles can interfere is

332
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:26,043
because complex numbers with magnitudes greater
than zero can add to zero. You can have a

333
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:30,088
complex number that points off in this direction,
another complex number that point off in that

334
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:35,591
direction. They always have magnitudes greater
than zero but they can add and destructively

335
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:41,019
interfere. The dynamics are continuous, time-symmetric,
fully deterministic and hence, reversible,

336
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,021
and so there's no place where you--there's
no place you can find anything that resembles

337
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:52,1905
collapse in this math. And no randomness either,
by the way. Going from amplitudes to probabilities

338
00:31:55,489 --> 00:32:01,201
by taking this wave function and squaring
it has no physical justification or whatsoever.

339
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:08,1921
It's purely a hack. But it's a hack that works
really, really well. So here's what the actual

340
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:16,1929
math looks like for the two-slit experiment.
This is, and if you go to actual papers on

341
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:19,074
quantum physics you won't find this in the
popular press, this is what you will find

342
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:26,1939
in physics journals. This is--or physics texts--this
is the state, the amplitude of the photon

343
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:33,049
being at the upper detector. This is the amplitude
of photon being at the lower detector and

344
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:37,027
we have to divide by the square root of two
in order to make the total probability come

345
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:44,1957
out to be one. So to figure out the probability,
we take this number, which is a complex number,

346
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:52,096
and take the modules and square it. And when
we do that, it's almost exactly the same as

347
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,027
just squaring A plus B in 8th grade algebra
class, you get A squared plus B squared plus

348
00:32:56,869 --> 00:33:01,029
AB plus BA. You have to take these complex
conjugates because they're complex numbers,

349
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,047
and the square root of negative one pops in
there to do some weird things, those kind

350
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:10,071
of details don't matter. The point is this
is a complex number, psi U is a complex number.

351
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:16,309
Its magnitude is a real number and when you
square it it's a positive real number. So

352
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:19,028
here we have a positive real number, here
we have another positive real number, the

353
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:24,064
sum of those two has to be a positive real
number. But over here we have two different

354
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:29,281
complex numbers and two different complex
numbers that were multiplied together so this

355
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:35,199
sum can be negative. So this is--this is where
the interference comes from. This is the mathematical

356
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:41,031
manifestation of interference in quantum mechanics.
That's what it looks like in terms of Greek

357
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:47,017
symbols. So, what happens when we add detectors?
Well, when we add detectors, the amplitude

358
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:53,073
starts to look like this. We have the amplitude
for the photon to be at the upper detector

359
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:59,591
times the amplitude for the detector to be
in the state where it shows that the particle

360
00:33:59,021 --> 00:34:04,629
is at the upper detector and the same thing
at the lower detector. So this is just the

361
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,861
mathematical description of that. And when
you--when you--when you take the amplitude

362
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:13,013
to that and square it, here's what you get,
same thing as before, psi U squared plus psi

363
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:20,2053
L squared. And this, which looks an awful
lot like an interference term, right, which

364
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:27,309
is weird because I just got though telling
you that if we have a detector that we know--tells

365
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:32,091
us which way the particle went, that destroys
the interference. Well, there's this subtle

366
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:37,053
difference here between what we have now-what
we have before, and that's this weird notation

367
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,011
here, which is called the rock--bracket notation.
You don't need to concern yourself with it.

368
00:34:41,011 --> 00:34:48,2081
Just take my word for it when I tell you that
this quantity here is the amplitude for the

369
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:54,038
detector to spontaneously switch between indicating
that the particle is at the upper slit and

370
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:59,064
the lower slit. In other words, it's a measure
of the reliability of the detector. That just

371
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:05,003
comes out when you do the math. And if the
detector is working properly, that value--oops--this--this

372
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:12,2105
value is the amplitude for it to spontaneously
switch between UNL and spontaneously switch

373
00:35:16,082 --> 00:35:23,2116
between L and U, those are both zero so this
term goes away. That's the math of how measurement

374
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:29,023
destroys probability. And the interesting
thing about this is that measurement is a

375
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:34,045
continuum. It's not a dichotomy. The math
tells us that we can measure just a little

376
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:41,2134
bit or we can measure mostly but not quite.
And we have vary--it's a varying levels of

377
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:47,031
interference that we get depending on whether
the measurement that we're making is reliable

378
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:54,2147
or not. That's what the math says. So what
about entanglement? Well, this is, if you

379
00:35:55,003 --> 00:36:01,023
go to a physics paper that talks about entangled
particles, this is what you will see as the

380
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:06,052
mathematical description of a pair of entangled
particles. What this means is that you have

381
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:12,021
an amplitude for the particle on the left
to be in the up state and the particle on

382
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:17,099
the right to be in the down state superimposed
with an amplitude for the particle on the

383
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:21,082
left to be in the down state and the particle
on the right to be in the up state; again,

384
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:28,2181
divided by the square root of two. Now, this
looks a lot like the--or the unmeasured two-slit

385
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:37,008
description. But there's some notational sleight
of hand going on here because this is shorthand

386
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:44,2197
for this and it's an unfamiliar notation.
This vertical bar, followed by the bracket,

387
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:49,078
this is a term. So you got--this is a quantum
wave function here. This is another quantum

388
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:55,088
wave function here. This is the wave function
for the upper particle. This is a wave function

389
00:36:55,075 --> 00:37:01,067
for the lower particle. Another way to write
that is--you don't have to use arrows, that's

390
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:05,008
just a notational convenience, so I could
call this the left upper particle and the

391
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:10,081
right downward particle, and the left downward
particle on the right upper particle. And

392
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:17,2230
this is just another way of writing this Psi,
this quantum wave function. So this and this

393
00:37:18,098 --> 00:37:22,088
are the same thing in different notations.
And this should now look familiar. This is

394
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:29,2242
exactly the same as--oops--as this, the two-slit
experiment with the detector, module of a

395
00:37:34,058 --> 00:37:41,2254
few labels. And so, that is now the answer
to the first part of the EPRG Paradox. In

396
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:49,002
fact, entanglement does count as a proto-measurement
that destroys interference. But it's actually

397
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:55,068
much deeper that that. According to the math,
entanglement and measurement or the exact

398
00:37:55,058 --> 00:38:02,2275
same phenomenon, the math is exactly the same,
and that is why entanglement destroys interference

399
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:07,075
because entanglement is measurement. And I
have a lot more to say about that later in

400
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:14,2287
the talk. So okay, so there's no interference
but now what about this last--the idea of

401
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:20,023
creating the interference using a quantum
eraser. So let's take another look at our--I'm

402
00:38:20,037 --> 00:38:26,045
running little short on time so I'm just going
to blast through this. This is what the state

403
00:38:26,082 --> 00:38:33,2306
equation looks like for the quantum eraser
after the so-called measurement but before

404
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:38,083
erasure. So you have an upper photon that's
horizontally polarized because we've--let's

405
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:45,2318
assume we start with a vertically polarized
light going in here and we measure by rotating

406
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:53,096
90 degrees. So we have now the upper photon
rotated from vertical to horizontal and the

407
00:38:53,051 --> 00:39:00,063
lower photon still vertical and this you will
now--you should recognize as a measured and

408
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:06,068
therefore non-interfering state. And it turns
out that if you filter now at 45 degrees this

409
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:13,2346
is the state function, the quantum wave function,
that you end up with. You now have a photon

410
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:19,061
that's either in the upper or lower slit and
that's either horizontally or vertically polarized,

411
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:24,009
and this kind of makes sense because if you
think of these as vectors and you have a horizontal

412
00:39:24,054 --> 00:39:29,055
polarization plus a vertical polarization,
that's a 45-degree polarization, which is

413
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:36,2369
exactly what you would expect to see if we're
filtering it 45 degrees, right? But remember

414
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:40,002
the square root of two term here that I told
you was there in order to make the total probability

415
00:39:40,056 --> 00:39:47,081
to come out to be one? Now, that's a two root
though, and if you run the math on this you

416
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:54,2387
find out that the total probability is not
one, it's one-half. So either we've made a

417
00:39:54,058 --> 00:40:01,2394
mistake or half our photons have gone missing.
Well, in fact, half our photons have gone

418
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:06,017
missing which is also shouldn't be too surprising
because we filtered--we put this 45-degree--we

419
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:13,2406
put this filter in place. This filter is filtering
out half the photons that go through it. If

420
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:18,053
it--if they come in at 45 degrees then half
of them come out polarized this way and the

421
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:25,2418
other half get blocked. So it turns out that
the other half, the half that didn't get through,

422
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:30,005
have a different wave function that has a
negative sign over here, which again, makes

423
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:37,068
intuitive sense because the filter lets these--the
filter is at 45 degrees so it lets this axis

424
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:44,2437
through and this axis, which is the H minus
V axis it blocks. And these photons interfere

425
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:53,093
with themselves and these photons also interfere
with themselves. So the photons that passed

426
00:40:53,073 --> 00:40:58,062
through the filter display interference fringes
and the photons that don't pass also display

427
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:02,011
interference but it turns out that they're
anti-fringes. They're exactly like the bright

428
00:41:02,046 --> 00:41:08,088
spots in the interference fringes for the
photons that got filtered out, exactly lined

429
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:14,024
up with the dark spots of the fringes for
the photons that were let through. And they

430
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:19,095
sum together to produce what we perceived
when we look at it as non-interference. So

431
00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:23,095
this quantum eraser doesn't actually erase
anything and it doesn't produce interference,

432
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:28,008
it just filters out interference that was
actually already there all along. And it turns

433
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:32,003
out that we can actually do this in the EPR
experiment too. And the way that we--but in

434
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:36,007
order to do it, we have to transmit classical
information from one side of the other in

435
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:42,058
order to do the filtering. The way it works
is you make a record of all the photons that

436
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:46,042
you collected over here and keep it in order
so you've got this record of first photon

437
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:50,2506
was at the upper detector, the second photon
was at the down detector, and so on and so

438
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:55,2510
forth, and over here you keep track of which
photons ended up where on your screen, and

439
00:41:55,066 --> 00:42:00,051
then you take this record and you transmit
it over here by some classical slower-than-light

440
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:04,088
channel. And you look at all the up photons
and sure enough there's an interference pattern,

441
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,008
and you look at all the down photons and sure
enough there's an interference pattern. But

442
00:42:06,085 --> 00:42:13,006
the only way to see that is to take classical
information and move it from here to here.

443
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:19,024
And that is the last nail in the coffin. I
was very disappointed when I learned this

444
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:24,054
10 years ago because I was really counting
on winning a Nobel Prize and taking over the

445
00:42:24,023 --> 00:42:31,2544
world but, oh, well, this is the next best
thing. So the take-home message up to this

446
00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:38,2551
point is measurement and entanglement are
the same phenomenon, and what you will find

447
00:42:39,005 --> 00:42:45,032
in many, many accounts and even some professional
accounts, is that they're completely different.

448
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:50,099
That measurement is this common everyday thing
that we can sort of intuitively grasp and

449
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:57,051
entanglement is the quintessential quantum
mystery and in fact they are really the exact

450
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:02,019
same thing. Now, having come to that realization
we can now tell a different story about quantum

451
00:43:02,051 --> 00:43:09,054
mechanics that to my software engineer's mind
is much more intuitively pleasing than any

452
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:15,006
of the other competing alternatives. So Copenhagen
is the most popular but as we've seen it,

453
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:22,2595
it's scientifically untenable. There just
is no collapse. Their--the next most popular

454
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:28,036
interpretation is the so-called "many worlds"
interpretation where it says that anytime

455
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:34,035
that a particle can go multiple ways, the
entire universe splits and the math actually

456
00:43:34,063 --> 00:43:40,065
supports that, but I personally find that
that takes a heavier toll on my intuition

457
00:43:40,028 --> 00:43:44,021
than I'm really willing to concede. There's
another thing that nobody's ever heard of

458
00:43:44,049 --> 00:43:48,003
called the "transactional" interpretation
by fellow named Cramer at the University of

459
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:50,042
Washington. Actually, if you're really interested
in this stuff, I encourage you to take a look

460
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:57,2630
at because it is kind of interesting. It postulates
that the backwards in time solution for Maxwell's

461
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:03,015
equation are physically real and if you make
that assumption then you can explain a lot

462
00:44:03,002 --> 00:44:06,067
of stuff, but I don't have time to get into
that. What I want to talk about here is the

463
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:12,039
quantum information theory which I have dubbed
the "zero-worlds" interpretation of quantum

464
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:17,044
mechanics. It's an extension of classical
information theory with complex numbers and

465
00:44:17,007 --> 00:44:22,085
if you run through that math you get some
very interesting results. So here is a lightning

466
00:44:22,055 --> 00:44:27,014
introduction to classical information theory.
It's the study of this quantity called the

467
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:33,036
Shannon entropy of a system A, which can be
in any one of a number of classical states,

468
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:37,032
and it's defined as the sum of the probability
that the system is in sum state A times the

469
00:44:37,037 --> 00:44:43,067
log of that probability and then you take
a negative sign. And intuitively, it's a measure

470
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:48,082
of the amount of randomness that's in the
system A. So just to simplify things for the

471
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:53,072
purpose of this talk, if the system has an
equal probability of being in one of N states,

472
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:59,092
then the entropy is just the log of N. So
when N is one and the system is definitely

473
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:05,091
in one state then the entropy is zero. And
if it can be in one of two states with equal

474
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:10,036
probability and we take this log base two,
we measure information content in bits, then

475
00:45:10,077 --> 00:45:17,2710
it has one bit of randomness in it. You can
define all kinds of other derived quantities

476
00:45:19,055 --> 00:45:23,022
like the joint entropy of multiple systems
and the conditional entropy, and this quantity

477
00:45:23,077 --> 00:45:28,037
here which is called the information entropy
which is a measure of how much information

478
00:45:28,014 --> 00:45:32,082
a system A contains about a system B, and
the interesting thing to note about it is

479
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:39,2732
it's the sum of some of these other quantities
that had been defined up here. And the information

480
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:46,084
entropy ranges between zero and one, where
zero means that this system has no--system

481
00:45:46,095 --> 00:45:51,098
A has no information about system B, they're
completely uncorrelated, and one means that

482
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:58,006
they're perfectly correlated. So for example,
because they're sums we can describe these

483
00:45:58,053 --> 00:46:05,2758
quantities as Venn diagrams. So this circle
here on the left is system A and this circle

484
00:46:05,073 --> 00:46:12,2765
on the right is the system B, and the total
entropy is contained inside these circles,

485
00:46:14,016 --> 00:46:19,027
the total entropy for each system, and the
information entropy is here in the intersection,

486
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:26,2779
and that leaves the conditional entropy out
here because the information entropy is the

487
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,2789
system's individual entropy minus the conditional
entropy, just simple addition. This is the

488
00:46:36,011 --> 00:46:40,062
important part. If we flip two coins so that
they're completely independent of each other,

489
00:46:40,073 --> 00:46:47,2800
this is what the numbers end up looking like.
The conditional entropy, the coin A has one

490
00:46:47,085 --> 00:46:51,006
bit of randomness and coin B has one bit of
randomness so the total entropy in the system

491
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:55,006
is two bits of randomness. The system as a
whole of these two coins can be in one of

492
00:46:55,097 --> 00:47:02,049
four states, the log of four is two, and there's
no information that one coin contains about

493
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:07,025
the other. By way of contrast, if we have
a coin with a sensor, just looking at that

494
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:13,005
coin telling us whether it's landed heads
or tails then--and the sensor is working properly,

495
00:47:13,076 --> 00:47:20,2833
then we have one bit of information entropy
because the sensor gives us perfect information

496
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:24,043
about the coin and vice versa by the way.
The coin gives us perfect information about

497
00:47:24,098 --> 00:47:29,094
the sensor, there's no directionality here,
and the total entropy in the system is one

498
00:47:29,092 --> 00:47:33,008
bit so it's only going to be in one of two
states, heads and sensor says heads, or tails

499
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:40,2853
and sensor says tails. If we extend, do the
same math again except using complex numbers

500
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:47,098
instead of real numbers then you end up with
something called the Von Neumann entropy which

501
00:47:47,006 --> 00:47:54,2867
is called S and this hairy-looking equation
over here, which I don't have time to go into,

502
00:47:54,053 --> 00:48:00,064
but the intuition is kind of the same as it
was before when we talked about how interference

503
00:48:00,017 --> 00:48:05,031
was produced. Because we're now dealing with
complex numbers rather than real numbers,

504
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:09,026
the information entropy is no longer restricted
to the range zero and one. And, in fact, entropies

505
00:48:09,074 --> 00:48:16,2889
are no longer restricted to be positive real
numbers, they can be negative. And this turns

506
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:24,094
out to be, if you do the math, the entropy
diagram for a pair of entangled particles.

507
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:30,057
You get a negative bit of entropy over here.
And the information entropy, the amount of

508
00:48:30,098 --> 00:48:35,001
information that one particle quantum information
now, that one particle contains about the

509
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:42,033
other is two bits. So you can think about
two entangled particles, the math is telling

510
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:46,041
us that these particles are now, somehow,
better than perfectly correlated. They have

511
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:53,096
become super correlated and the total entropy
of this system, the sum of all these numbers,

512
00:48:53,069 --> 00:49:00,2933
is zero. There's no randomness. That's not
yet the cool part. What happens when we take

513
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:07,046
a measurement? Well, when we take measurement,
we have a particle that becomes entangled

514
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:12,051
with a macroscopic system of particles. So
what happens if we have three mutually entangled

515
00:49:12,002 --> 00:49:19,2952
particles? You end up with a Venn diagram
that looks like this and if we assume a two-state

516
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:27,074
system then the actual numbers come out looking
like this. You've got one bit of information

517
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:31,057
entropy between A and C, one bit between A
and B, and you've got this negative, this

518
00:49:31,008 --> 00:49:38,2971
weird negative entropies over here and it's
all kind of mind-boggling. But let's imagine

519
00:49:41,092 --> 00:49:46,085
that this particle down here is the one that
we're measuring and this is our--these two

520
00:49:46,077 --> 00:49:50,018
particles here are our measurement apparatus.
And let's look just at the measurement apparatus

521
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:56,038
and ignore the fact that we're actually measuring
a particle here. So we're going to take this

522
00:49:56,033 --> 00:50:02,066
particle C, we're just going to throw it out
for a minute. It turns out that ignoring C

523
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:09,3002
is exactly what is represented by this trace
operator here that ends up showing up in the

524
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:18,3011
math. Look what happens. This one bit of information
entropy--we lose this boundary so this one,

525
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:27,001
the negative one, cancel out and become a
zero, same thing over here, and what we have

526
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:34,3027
is if we ignore this is exactly the same system
from an information theoretical point of view

527
00:50:36,035 --> 00:50:42,006
as a coin with a sensor, we have two classical
particles that are perfectly correlated with

528
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:49,3042
each other in a classical sense. I should
remind you of the experiment that we did at

529
00:50:50,045 --> 00:50:57,3050
the beginning of the talk where everybody
agreed that that's something was green. And

530
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:02,007
we can get that from quantum mechanics, we
get these two systems that are in classical

531
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:06,033
correlation. But we did that not by actual--not
by having an objective physical reality that

532
00:51:06,056 --> 00:51:10,028
we reflect but actually by ignoring the thing
that we're measuring, or that we think we're

533
00:51:10,084 --> 00:51:16,061
measuring. As it turns out that this extends
to any macroscopic ecosystem. If you add an

534
00:51:16,045 --> 00:51:20,003
arbitrary number of particles the entropy
diagram ends up looking exactly the same.

535
00:51:20,075 --> 00:51:25,066
So, this is now the mathematical description
of a quantum measurement. You have the system

536
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:32,3085
that you're measuring. It's particle Q. It
interacts and gets entangled with A particle,

537
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:39,026
which is in the parlance of the theory called
an ancilla which is why they label it A, and

538
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:45,093
that ancilla then gets entangled with a macroscopic
measurement apparatus in system of 10 to the

539
00:51:45,007 --> 00:51:50,066
23 particles, and the entropy diagram ends
up looking exactly the same where this entire

540
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:57,3110
system has the same quantum information, theoretical
information content, as the third particle

541
00:51:58,042 --> 00:52:05,3118
in a three-particle entangled system. So,
that is now a description of what measurement

542
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:09,009
looks like purely in terms of quantum mechanics.
And the interesting thing about that is it

543
00:52:09,097 --> 00:52:15,043
describes all of the microscopic phenomenon
that we see that we naively observe about

544
00:52:15,004 --> 00:52:19,015
classical measurements but it's purely in
terms of quantum mechanics, which means that

545
00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:26,3139
it's reversible. So, their--so, somehow, we
ought to be able to undo an actual physical

546
00:52:29,027 --> 00:52:35,045
classical measurement but in practice we can't
seem to. And the reason for that is because

547
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:40,021
in order to do that--in theory, it's possible,
but in practice we would have to undo all

548
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:46,033
of the entanglements in this macroscopic system.
So, for me, to now go back in--back in time,

549
00:52:46,026 --> 00:52:51,097
you know, we aren't really going back in time,
but for me to erase all of your memories of

550
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:55,045
having seen this green thing on the screen
and agreed that it was green at the beginning

551
00:52:55,068 --> 00:53:02,077
of the screen, I would have to undo this enormous
web of entanglement that has since proliferated

552
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:06,096
at the speed of light. I have to bring all
those particles back together and recombine

553
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:11,056
them. And in principle, that's possible and
in practice, obviously, it's not, which is

554
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:18,3191
why classical measurement seems to be irreversible
despite the fact that the physics of the universe

555
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:25,046
say that everything is reversible. So, this
has some philosophical implications. I call

556
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:31,014
it the zero universe interpretation of quantum
mechanics. If you really--if you buy this

557
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:35,074
as a description of what the physics of the
universe is really like, then it tells you

558
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:42,015
unambiguously that it is not the case; that
the reason that measurements are consistent

559
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:49,3222
across space and time is because there's a
real underlying metaphysical reality out there.

560
00:53:49,061 --> 00:53:56,3229
It tells you in fact, the exact opposite,
that what we really are is, as David Mermin

561
00:53:57,096 --> 00:54:03,026
puts it, "correlations without correlata."
We are not made of atoms we are actually made

562
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:10,3243
of bits. We are our thoughts and these thoughts
actually reside, if you will forgive stretching

563
00:54:11,058 --> 00:54:15,038
a metaphor to the breaking point, we are a
simulation running on a quantum computer.

564
00:54:15,096 --> 00:54:22,3255
I'm going to skip that. So, the take-home
message is, going back to this Einstein quote

565
00:54:25,072 --> 00:54:28,097
that, "The most incomprehensible thing about
the universe is that it's comprehensible."

566
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:33,058
Here's an explanation in terms of physical
theory of why the universe is comprehensible.

567
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:39,072
Quantum mechanics actually predicts a comprehensible
universe but at the cost of forcing you to

568
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:44,061
believe that what you perceive as physical
reality is not actually real it's actually

569
00:54:44,006 --> 00:54:51,3284
an illusion. And the motto here is that "spooky
action at a distance" is no more and no less

570
00:54:54,077 --> 00:55:01,097
mysterious than the "spooky action across
time" that lets us perceive the universe as

571
00:55:01,074 --> 00:55:05,078
consistent from one moment to the next. They're
both produced by the exact, same physical

572
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:12,3305
phenomenon, namely entanglement. And I'll
leave you with this quote from an ancient

573
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:21,3314
Japanese Zen master and open the floor for
questions. Uh-oh, the physicists are walking

574
00:55:27,096 --> 00:55:34,3327
out. Yeah?
>> So you have the three particles when you

575
00:55:37,017 --> 00:55:44,3337
remove from the shell what the main two look
like and they were building to the point in

576
00:55:50,052 --> 00:55:50,025
the sensor. Why not leave the--what happens
when you leave a third particle away? And

577
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:56,005
if you're taking that as another thought experiments
and say, "Well, this is equivalent too."

578
00:55:56,016 --> 00:55:57,199
>> GARRET: Yeah. Well, this is--so these are
all just math, right?

579
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,331
>> Right.
>> GARRET: So, these are all mathematical

580
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:06,3359
manipulations, the results of which we interpret
in order to tell stories about what our world

581
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:12,093
is like. And if you leave it in, then what
you have is a description of the unadulterated

582
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:18,039
underlying physical reality, which is quantum.
And the reason that's hard to wrap your brain

583
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:24,067
around is because your brain is classical,
everything that you are is classical. You're

584
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:30,034
made of classical bits that ones--or you're
a Turing machine, you're not a quantum computer,

585
00:56:30,032 --> 00:56:35,026
but you're made out of a quantum computer.
And that's why there's this fundamental disconnect

586
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,016
that will always take a toll in our intuitions
that will never go away because they're really

587
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:44,028
fundamentally different. The difference between
real numbers and complex numbers, the underlying

588
00:56:44,002 --> 00:56:49,031
reality is complex, but the thing that is
processing the information that lets you think

589
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:55,017
about these things is real. It's made of real
numbers. That's really the underlying--the

590
00:56:55,005 --> 00:56:59,046
pithiest way I know of summarizing this so
it just depends on what point of view you

591
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:06,083
want to take.
>> I'd like to make a short pitch for the

592
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:13,3426
multiple universes and hear your response.
The multiple universes, one way to look at

593
00:57:14,008 --> 00:57:21,3434
it is the natural equation, it allows for--because
it's linear, you can have things occurring

594
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:29,3442
that live in the same equation and sometimes,
say, with the dead and a live cat, you can

595
00:57:31,095 --> 00:57:37,026
see that you can actually sort of separate
them, each goes its own way, they don't interact

596
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:44,3457
much, so a very good approximation is to consider
them one at a time. However, when real quantum

597
00:57:45,082 --> 00:57:51,015
effects go then you cannot do it this way.
So, there are--there are some things that

598
00:57:51,097 --> 00:57:58,045
you can separate and some not. So, now, you're
saying that you have an interpretation of

599
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:00,046
a one universe so...
>> GARRET: No, not one. Zero.

600
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:03,048
>> Zero, all right.
>> GARRET: Very important distinction. One

601
00:58:03,036 --> 00:58:05,489
universe, one classical universe really is
untenable.

602
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:10,171
>> Well...
>> GARRET: You can--you can--that's Copenhagen.

603
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:13,053
>> Yeah.
>> GARRET: You can--you can--yes, the--so

604
00:58:13,055 --> 00:58:18,086
the question was, what do I think about multiple
universes? Multiple universes are just as

605
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:25,088
tenable, according the math, as zero universes.
The only thing that's not tenable is one classical

606
00:58:25,029 --> 00:58:28,042
universe, that's--that's the only thing that
the math tells you unambiguously does not

607
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:35,3508
exist. And it's a matter of taste. You know,
I personally--one of the things that the--that

608
00:58:36,022 --> 00:58:42,094
the math tells you if you think about it in
terms of multiple universes, is that once

609
00:58:42,016 --> 00:58:49,3522
you get beyond a certain level of separation
these universes are forever inaccessible to

610
00:58:49,044 --> 00:58:56,064
us, even, you know, to any reasonable degree
of approximation. And then there's this philosophical

611
00:58:56,008 --> 00:59:03,3536
question of is the thing actually real and
the analogy that--the best analogy that I've

612
00:59:04,056 --> 00:59:10,021
heard is imagine a photon that leaves the
back of the sun and goes away from us and

613
00:59:10,077 --> 00:59:17,3550
so it's forever outside our light cone, is
that photon real? And my reply to that is

614
00:59:21,043 --> 00:59:24,091
there's a difference between the photon that
leaves the back of the sun and travels away

615
00:59:24,034 --> 00:59:29,095
from us because there's always the possibility
that somewhere out there's a mirror that's

616
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:34,036
going to reflect that photon back to us and
we won't know that until that mirror actually

617
00:59:34,065 --> 00:59:41,3574
reflects it and it comes back and we can see.
But in the case of multiple universes, we

618
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:45,013
know unambiguously the math tells us so that
once another universe splits off, it's never

619
00:59:45,009 --> 00:59:51,003
coming back. There's no way to bring it back.
>> After a concurrent time, it will.

620
00:59:51,002 --> 00:59:55,096
>> GARRET: Excuse me?
>> After a concurrent time, it will.

621
00:59:55,016 --> 01:00:02,3595
>> GARRET: Okay, in any amount of time that
we have any practical reason to care about.

622
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:09,3602
So, yes, if you're thinking cosmologically,
multiple universes is a--is a tenable interpretation.

623
01:00:12,091 --> 01:00:18,074
If you're thinking in terms--if--if you want
a story that you can help you to understand

624
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:24,052
how the universe works in terms of your everyday
life and what your fundamental nature is,

625
01:00:24,017 --> 01:00:30,091
I personally find that I gravitate more towards
the information theoretic point of view and

626
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:36,044
believing that--that I'm--I--the universe
that I exist in is a very good high-quality

627
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:42,018
simulation. But that's a matter of taste.
>> So do multiple universes conserve mass

628
01:00:42,007 --> 01:00:47,035
energy?
>> GARRET: That I don't know. I have to defer

629
01:00:47,005 --> 01:00:52,091
that to the physicists. That's a very good
question. I don't--I actually don't know the

630
01:00:52,096 --> 01:00:59,3652
answer to that.
>> Could you amplify a bit more for what does

631
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:01,085
a zero universe mean?
>> GARRET: This--oh, by the way, the question

632
01:01:01,013 --> 01:01:05,007
back here was do multiple universes conserve
mass energy. It's a very--a very good question

633
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:09,059
because--and I don't know the answer. I should--I
should ask--I need to ask a physicist who...

634
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:16,3669
>> I've asked this question of "many worlds"
proponent and the answer I got is, yes, that

635
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:24,3677
you're not actually doubling the amount of
mass, you're dividing the amount of mass into

636
01:01:25,009 --> 01:01:26,041
two effectively but...
>> GARRET: Oh, okay. So somebody in the audience

637
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:31,045
is saying that when universes split, the total
amount of mass in the universe gets evenly

638
01:01:31,095 --> 01:01:36,027
divided between the two universes and I'm
guessing that math works out in such a way

639
01:01:36,022 --> 01:01:41,096
that if you reduce the amount of mass in a
classical universe uniformly by one half,

640
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:45,006
that everything ends up working out the same
as it did before. But I'm going to have to

641
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:46,095
think about that.
>> So this is just even one universe does

642
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:47,042
not conserve mass energy with anything. Universes
as whole...

643
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:49,719
>> GARRET: Okay.
>> And yet, in one--in the universe we're

644
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:56,811
in, we don't seem to see this mass dwindling
away.

645
01:01:56,068 --> 01:01:59,055
>> But it's, you know, because we're doing
the same...

646
01:01:59,023 --> 01:02:04,017
>> GARRET: Yeah. So in that, we are now beyond
the limits of my knowledge of this stuff.

647
01:02:04,004 --> 01:02:07,075
Yeah?
>> For those of us who are intrigued and teased,

648
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:10,019
where can we learn more?
>> GARRET: So, I have paper about this. It's

649
01:02:10,034 --> 01:02:17,3730
on the web. I highly recommend David Mermin's
book, Boojums: All the Way Through, where

650
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:24,076
he doesn't actually talk about this but he
talks about the Bell inequality in a very

651
01:02:24,004 --> 01:02:30,024
accessible way, which is also--I didn't have
time to talk about that but it's very worthwhile

652
01:02:30,028 --> 01:02:36,077
knowing about. Or send--send me an email.
I can actually put you in touch with the guys

653
01:02:36,005 --> 01:02:38,064
whose research this talk is based on. They're
down at Caltech, I think. Yeah?

654
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:41,028
>> So is this an entirely local theory that
all interactions are interacting locally propagating

655
01:02:41,097 --> 01:02:48,3761
at the speed of light, or is it?
>> GARRET: Well, so this get--so, the question

656
01:02:54,097 --> 01:03:01,3774
was is this a local, purely local theory.
It's quantum mechanics. And whether quantum

657
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:09,3782
mechanics is purely local is the subject of
debate. And it depends--it depends on what

658
01:03:10,031 --> 01:03:17,3790
you mean by purely local. Classically, it's
not, and quantum mechanically, it is. You

659
01:03:18,016 --> 01:03:25,3798
know, I--this sheds no extra light on that
question. Okay, I guess, that's it.
