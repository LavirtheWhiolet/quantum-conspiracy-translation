00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,460
GLECKLER: Hi everyone. I'm Arthur Gleckler and I'm happy to introduce Dr. Ron Garret

3
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,340
here, who's going to be speaking about quantum mechanics today. He's a former Googler from

4
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,980
the very early days of the company, around 2000. He was the lead engineer on the first

5
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,980
release of AdWords and the original author of the Google translation console. He also

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,390
wrote the first billing system that Google used. Also, for many years, he worked at the

7
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,760
NASA Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, specializing in AI and robotics. I'm hoping to convince

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,550
him to come back and talk about his experiences, debugging spacecraft 250 million miles from

9
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:09,880
the earth. Here's Ron.
>> GARRET: Thanks. So I'm told that my abstract

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,440
caused a little bit of a kerfuffle so let me start out with a couple of disclaimers

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,690
upfront to kind of manage expectations. The title of the talk was intended to be tongue-in-cheek.

12
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,850
There is no actual conspiracy, at least, as far as I know but there is a fairly big disconnect

13
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,040
between what you read about quantum mechanics in the popular press and what the actual underlying

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,310
truth is, and that's what this talk is about. I am not a physicist. Do we have any actual

15
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:44,259
physicists in the crowd? Oh, boy, okay. You can make sure you keep me honest. I'm a software

16
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:50,710
engineer. I came upon this about actually 20 years ago when I read an article in Scientific

17
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,740
American and I thought, "This can't possibly be right." And it took me 10 years to finally

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,159
find a physicist at Caltech who could explain to me why in fact it wasn't right and at that

19
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,130
point, everything just kind of clicked and quantum mechanics made a lot more sense to

20
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,369
me than it did before. And that's what this talk is about. It's about--it's about a different

21
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:17,340
way to think about QM that hasn't gotten very much attention and dispels this idea that

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,130
quantum mechanics is sort of intractably weird. Somebody has said to me once that quantum

23
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:28,299
mechanics obeys the law of conservation of weirdness. And to a certain extent, that is

24
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:33,820
true. There is a certain amount of--quantum mechanics extracts a toll on your intuition

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,449
and some of that will never go away. But I don't think that quantum mechanics needs to

26
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:44,459
be fundamentally any more incomprehensible than, say, relativity which most technical

27
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,449
people seem to have no trouble wrapping their brains around nowadays. So with that sort

28
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,419
of expectation management out of the way, I want to start out by inviting you to think

29
00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:00,519
about the question, "What does it mean to 'measure' something?" So, imagine that we're

30
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:08,070
sitting here doing some experiment. We have some system--let me grab a pointer--that we

31
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,540
want to measure some property of it so we have some, you know, sensor here like a camera,

32
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,519
and it gathers some data and we feed it to a computer, and that data shall pop up from

33
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,190
the screen, and we look at that with our eyes, and we form some mental image in our head,

34
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,859
and how do we know that this mental image that we form in our head actually corresponds

35
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:32,350
to underlying physical reality? Well, one indication that we have of this is that we

36
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,380
can do experiments more than once and observe that we get consistent results. So, for example,

37
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,470
what color is this?
>> Green.

38
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:48,669
>> GARRET: Green, yes. So we can observe through
our common everyday experience that the results

39
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:54,910
of measurements are consistent across space and time. And, I mean, this is really a very

40
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:01,260
reliable aspect of our universe, but it's actually a very deep mystery why this is so.

41
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,650
And Einstein famously said that, "The most incomprehensible thing about the universe

42
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,530
is that it is comprehensible." We can actually do experiments and get results that are consistent

43
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,340
across space and time and we don't really know why that, any inherent reason, why that

44
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:22,930
should be the case. Now, there is one very plausible sounding explanation of why this

45
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,910
is the case, and that is that the results of these measurements are actually an accurate

46
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,810
reflection of some underlying metaphysical reality. That reality, that there really is

47
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,220
a universe out there and when we measure it, we're getting back actual information about

48
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,900
that underlying physical reality. And that is the reason why these measurements are consistent

49
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,580
because reality sees to it that that's the case. Well, it turns out that we can demonstrate

50
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,730
that that's not true. I'm about to lead you down a rabbit hole but my purpose in leading

51
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,130
you down this rabbit hole is to do it in such a way that you can find your way back out

52
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,220
again. So I'm going to do it very carefully, step by step, and tell you in advance where

53
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,160
we're going. I'm going to start out by reviewing the usual QM story. What you will read if

54
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,320
you go to a popular account of quantum mechanics that you read, you know, pick up at Amazon

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:23,180
or a bookstore or read about it in Wired or whatever. I'll then show you how that story

56
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,340
can't possibly be true, because if that story were true, it would lead to a violation of

57
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,530
relativity, in particular, it would lead to faster-than-light communication. And it doesn't

58
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,910
do this in the usual way that most people think that it leads to faster-than-light communication,

59
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,850
it does it in a more subtle way that really hasn't gotten a lot of attention. So you physicists

60
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:47,430
in the room, bear with me. Then, I'm going to walk you through some of the actual underlying

61
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:53,010
mathematics of quantum mechanics, in a way that is accessible to anyone who knows--can

62
00:05:53,010 --> 00:06:02,420
do basic algebra and knows what algorithm is. And finally, tell a new story based on

63
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,440
our understanding of what the underlying mathematics actually says about what's really going on

64
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,870
and hopefully we'll achieve enlightenment at the end of that. So, is there anybody here

65
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,889
who has not heard of the two-slit experiment? All right, good. I will just blast through

66
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:25,740
this very quickly. So, we have a--this is--you have a laser that shines through two-slits,

67
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,180
and you get an interference pattern that shows that light is a wave and can interfere with

68
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:40,030
itself like any other wave. And there are two strange things about this. If you look

69
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:46,360
at the results of this experiment with very low intensity light, what you find is, and

70
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,250
this isn't showing up very well, but this top image here shows just some dots scattered

71
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,550
randomly. And then dots get denser and denser and denser until down here at the bottom you

72
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,220
have a dense enough pattern of dots that you can start to see this interference pattern

73
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,780
start to emerge. And this is an actual photograph of laser light going through a single slit

74
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,600
and going through two slits. And you can see this interference pattern here, this is actual,

75
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,540
an actual photograph of the same experiment, this particular one happened to be done with

76
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:24,740
electrons but the underlying physics is the same. And the--the thing to notice here is

77
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,450
that the total amount of light that you get in this pattern when there are two slits is

78
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,280
brighter than the overall amount of light that you get with one slit which is what you

79
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,389
would expect but that there are some places here where you have these dark bands that

80
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,810
were bright up here when you only had one slit. And this is the interesting part that

81
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,460
you want to kind of focus your attention on because what this means is that there's a

82
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,450
spot here where light was shining and then you open up an extra path for light to get

83
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:01,700
to the screen and that spot goes dark. And that is the manifestation of interference.

84
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,620
But the strange thing about it is that this is not a continuous phenomenon, it's an accumulation

85
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,600
of all these particles. Now, I can actually--I used to think that this was a fairly subtle

86
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,570
experiment that you need a specialized equipment to conduct this experiment. It turns out it's

87
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,340
not true, you can actually do this experiment yourself. These are some pencil leads that

88
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,760
I've taped together with scotch tape and this is an ordinary laser pointer. And if I pass

89
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,839
these, and there's just some very narrow gaps between these leads, so you can actually see

90
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,060
this happen if I pass the leads in front of this pointer, you can see the light start

91
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:44,970
to spread out. And if you're close enough, you can actually see the interference bands.

92
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,790
I don't think you can see it in the back. But if you're interested, after the talk,

93
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,420
come up, I'll give you a closer look at it. You can actually see the interference pattern.

94
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,990
The point here is that this is not a subtle phenomenon and it's not something that you

95
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,430
need expensive equipment to reproduce. This is an everyday experience for modern humans,

96
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:11,990
at least. Okay, so this is not yet intractably weird, because there are all kinds of explanations

97
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,330
that we can postulate about how this might be happening. So, for example, photons and

98
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,650
electrons might be real particles that have real locations and velocities like our intuitions

99
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,440
about particles that might be pushed around by some kind of underlying wave. And--oh,

100
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,960
I forgot to mention--whoops--the location where these particles accumulate is random,

101
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,380
there's no known way to predict other than statistically where these particles are going

102
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:47,250
to end up on the screen. So, the randomness might just be due to some underlying real

103
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,130
physical property that we just don't know how to measure. But it turns out we can eliminate

104
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,370
this possibility as well. And the way we do that is by asking--by trying to track the

105
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:03,070
path of a particle and ask with--on its way to the screen, on its way to producing this

106
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,210
interference pattern, which of these two slits did it go through? And we could do that. We

107
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:12,850
can add detectors to the slits and we can measure which of the two slits a particle

108
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,750
went through. But it turns out that when we do that the interference pattern goes away

109
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:24,210
and the phenomenon that we were trying to get a better grip on has changed. And it turns

110
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,600
out that this is an inherent feature of quantum mechanics, that any modification that we make

111
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,870
to this experiment that allows us to determine, even in principle, which of these slits this

112
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:45,270
particle went through destroys the interference. This is the famous wave particle duality,

113
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,839
any modification that allows us to determine even in principle--yeah?

114
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,390
>> You ask people in the VC to mute their
mics so...

115
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,430
>> GARRET: So, I've been asked to ask the
people on the VC to mute their mics, did I

116
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:08,080
get that right? Okay. Okay, anyway, so the conclusion from this observation is that something

117
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,110
has to be--something has to be at both slits in order to produce interference. And the

118
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,820
reason we know that is because we don't actually need both of these detectors, one of them

119
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:24,890
is enough, because if we have one detector and it fails to register that we know the

120
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,080
particle went through the other slit. Now, that particle going through the other slit,

121
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:34,250
it never interacted with anything, the particle never interacted with anything, but because

122
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,310
it allows us to know where the particle was even though we didn't actually measure it,

123
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,470
that's enough to destroy the interference and so this particle that's over here must

124
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,910
somehow have known that we were looking over here even though the particle itself wasn't

125
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,960
there. So, something must have been there to be able to tell that we had a detector

126
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:59,680
here, but we don't know what that is. Now, it turns out, this is again, this is a universal

127
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,620
property of quantum mechanics. It holds for any kind of particle--in practice, that means

128
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,339
photons and electrons because that's all there is in this universe unless you start getting

129
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,149
into nuclear physics. And any kind of measurement, and any kind two-slit experiment, any experiment

130
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,360
where you provide two different paths for the particle to potentially go down and bring

131
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,520
it back together without knowing which way it actually went will produce interference

132
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,720
and any modification that you make that lets you figure you out where it went will destroy

133
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,740
that interference. Now, this is still not intractably weird because we can still tell

134
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,209
a reasonable story about why this might happen. So, maybe measurement does something to this

135
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:41,120
system. These are after all very small particles and very delicate systems and so maybe it's

136
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,839
just physically impossible to make a measurement without disturbing the system in a way that

137
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,399
is the cause of the destruction of this interference. Maybe the wave function collapses and becomes

138
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,730
a particle somehow, this is the famous Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. But it

139
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,490
turns out that we can rule out that possibility as well. And the way we rule out that possibility

140
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:11,980
is by asking, "How and when does this collapse, this purported collapse, happen?" Collapse

141
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,209
has a number of features that ought to make us very suspicious of it just at priority

142
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:23,250
without even doing any experiments. It's a discontinuous and nonreversible phenomenon

143
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,000
that once you know that a particle has gone through one slit or the other, you can't go

144
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,790
roll back time and undo that. And if you look at the mathematics of quantum mechanics, which

145
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,880
we'll get to later, there's nothing in the math that's discontinuous. And more than that,

146
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,980
all the math is actually time reversible so we can make a--hypothesize that this collapse

147
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,330
happens, but this is fundamentally at odds with the mathematics of what quantum mechanics--of

148
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,820
how quantum mechanic says that our universe works. So we can actually do better than that.

149
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:04,430
We can actually do an experiment to show that collapse, if it happens, is a much subtler

150
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:11,480
phenomenon than it would've first appear and this is the famous--this is the quantum mystery

151
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,640
number two, the famous quantum eraser. Now, I--this is a two-slit experiment that I have

152
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,390
now reduced to something more abstract. So we have some particle source, this can be

153
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:27,570
photons or electrons. We have some abstract way of splitting up particles so that it has

154
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:35,220
two different paths to go down and some abstract way of recombining that particle so that both

155
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,850
of those paths end up in the same place so that we get interference. And here notionally,

156
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:45,690
we have one detector at one of these dark fringes and another one at a bright fringe

157
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:51,410
so that if we introduce some kind of an abstract measurement on one of these branches then

158
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:58,519
the interference pattern fusses out, that we now have the path, the amount of light,

159
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,820
in each detector. So now we don't have fringes anymore, we have the spread-out pattern that

160
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,670
we saw and the single slit version of the experiment. Like I said, there are lots of

161
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,170
different ways that you can do this--actually, let me go on to the next one. So it turns

162
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:20,140
out that you can erase this, that there are physical ways that if this measurement, certain

163
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,450
kinds of proto measurements, that you can do here, you can then go back and erase after

164
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:32,279
the fact and restore the interference. And here's a concrete example of that. If we depolarize

165
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,149
light and--I'm actually going to show you this in just a second, so bear with me if

166
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,510
you don't understand what I'm about to say, you use polarized light and you do the measurement

167
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:46,029
by rotating that light 90 degrees and then erase it by filtering it 45 degrees, that

168
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:51,920
is an actual concrete example of a quantum eraser. And I can't show you the interference

169
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,089
part of it but I can show you the erasure part. So what I have here is some Polaroid

170
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:03,899
film, this is the same stuff that you find in polarized sunglasses. And, I first want

171
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:10,899
to convince you, has anyone not played with this stuff before? Okay, so again, real quick.

172
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:16,220
If the--if the axis of the film are aligned then you can see through it. Can everybody

173
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:22,959
see through this? And if I rotate it at 90 degrees then you can't see through it anymore

174
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,660
and that effect is independent of the absolute orientation of the film so the light that's

175
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:33,730
going through to your eyes starts at unpolarized over here, it gets--passes through this film

176
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,810
and becomes polarized, let's say in this direction, and I can demonstrate then that it has become

177
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:45,760
polarized in that direction by filtering it out using a filter at 90 degrees. And there's

178
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,450
also this cool adjunct to the experiment that you can do by adding a filter at 45 degrees.

179
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,649
If you put it in front or behind, nothing happens which is pretty much what you--what

180
00:16:54,649 --> 00:17:01,980
you'd expect. But if you slide this in between, then suddenly you can see through it again.

181
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:09,740
Pretty cool, huh? And the reason for that is because if you start out with polarized

182
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,949
light and you filter it at 45 degrees then some of it gets through and it's now polarized

183
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,620
in this direction. And now I can do the same operation again, which is now the relative

184
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,870
orientation of these two are 45 degrees so some of it gets through again. But that's

185
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:32,289
not what I want to show you, that's not the cool part. Cool part is this stuff. This is

186
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:36,679
what they didn't show you, what they didn't show you in high school. This film is actually

187
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:45,929
a polarization rotator. If I'd stick this in here, I can actually take this light that's

188
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,769
polarizing this direction, I can rotate it to 90 degrees that it's polarizing the same

189
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:56,259
direction as this film. And the thing to notice here is that the apparent brightness here

190
00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:01,799
in the center is the same as it is up here. There's before, if we did the high school

191
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:20,320
version of the experiment--whoops--you've gotten quite a bit of loss.  So, I really can take--I can take light and

192
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,480
I can polarize it and I can take that polarized light and I can rotate it by 90 degrees and

193
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,749
so I can create two different paths so I can tell which way the light went through. I can

194
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:34,989
tell whether the light is going through here or whether the light is going through here.

195
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:41,679
Actually, let me back up a step. My claim is, without this filter, it's a little hard.

196
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,389
My claim is that the light that's coming out of here is different than the light that's

197
00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:49,679
coming out of here, so I can tell which way it went. And the way that I can demonstrate

198
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:56,059
that to you is with this measurement apparatus that lets me filter out this light and tell

199
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:01,039
which way it went. So this is a measurement. This should collapse the wave function according

200
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:09,379
to the Copenhagen interpretation. But I can undo this, and the way I undo it is by filtering

201
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:14,679
at 45 degrees. And now, I have to ask you for a little bit of suspension of disbelief

202
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:19,009
because this is not high precision optical equipment and my angles aren't aligned just

203
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:23,299
right. And if you look very closely, you will actually be able to tell the difference between

204
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:31,009
these two paths, but the difference is now much less than it was before. See that? Oh,

205
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:37,960
I'm sorry. I didn't realize there are people over there. Okay, I'll just show you all this

206
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,679
at close range afterwards. So there's a measurement. There's an erasure of that measurement. The

207
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:51,899
light is going this way so the--in time, the erasure has to happen after the measurement.

208
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,659
And if I actually had a laser to shine through this, I can demonstrate to you that the interference

209
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:03,149
would go away and would come back. So again, these are not subtle effects and they're not

210
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:09,730
effects that you necessarily need high precision equipment to reproduce, it's an everyday experiment.

211
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:19,070
This is $30 worth of polarizing film. So this leaves us with the philosophical conundrum

212
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:26,440
that is embodied by Schrodinger's cat. If there's no collapse, then if we set up a radioactive

213
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,049
source that triggers some kind of a mechanism that will break a bottle of poison that will

214
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:36,989
kill a cat that's in a sealed box, can this--what happens? Quantum mechanics says that this

215
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:43,559
cat isn't a quantum superposition of being alive and dead which is intuitively absurd

216
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:50,779
but as far as we can tell, that's really what happens. So if that's not intractably weird

217
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:57,470
enough for you, this is the third quantum mystery entanglement which is usually described

218
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:02,009
as sort of an ancillary phenomenon to all these other mysteries. And, oh, yes. It's

219
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:08,279
sort of--oh, by the way, has everybody seen this picture? Has anybody not seen this picture

220
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:14,690
before? Okay. This is what the production of quantum entangled photons really looks

221
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,019
like. You take a--this is not--this is not an actual photograph, this is a drawing. But

222
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,850
this is an actual photograph of the output of one of these gadgets. There's an ultraviolet

223
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,450
laser that shines through a crystal of some material called beta barium borate, details

224
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,489
don't matter, and this crystal has this interesting property that it will absorb photons of ultraviolet

225
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:39,029
light and reemit them in--and that it'll kick an electron up to an excited state, and then

226
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,989
that electron will drop back down to its ground state and it will do it in two steps. And

227
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:48,379
so it will kick up in one step, down in two, and in the process of coming back down, it

228
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:55,440
will emit two photons instead of one so what comes out of this system is visible light.

229
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,029
And the photons always come out in pairs and they come out in matched sets because of fundamental

230
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:09,029
conservation laws. We have law--conservation of energy and momentum and so--and electron--a

231
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:14,179
photon that, say, comes out over here is a red, photon will be matched by one that comes

232
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:20,509
out over here as a blue photon, and the same thing over here. And in the middle, you get

233
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:25,350
this band where you get photons that come out at the same wavelength and it just matched

234
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:29,669
in position so a photon over here will be matched by one over here. And they'll also

235
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:37,489
be matched in polarization as it turns out. So this is the way it's depicted conceptually.

236
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:41,190
You have these ultraviolet lasers. It's called a down convert--this crystal is called a down

237
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:47,399
converter, and you send these photons off to opposite sides of the universe and what--and

238
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:53,619
then you measure some property out of them. Let's say, we split them according to polarization

239
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,799
or position them in, it doesn't matter, any quantum state variables, as long as you can

240
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,489
filter them that way and what you find is that they're perfectly anti-correlated because

241
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:05,350
of the conservations laws. So if you get a photon up here, on the right side of the experiment

242
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,889
at the upper detector, that will always be matched by a photon over here on the left

243
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:17,539
side of the experiment at the down detector. An unfortunate artifact of the English language

244
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,220
that words "left" and "lower" both start with a letter L so I'm going to switch back and

245
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:29,440
forth between them. This is what the--what Einstein famously called, "Spooky action at

246
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,700
a distance." If you take this phenomenon, this isn't controversial, this is an experimental--an

247
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:42,109
undeniable experimental result, this really does happen, combine that with a fact if there

248
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:47,659
is no collapse with the wave function and the inescapable conclusion seems to be that

249
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:52,729
as it was put in Wired as recently as last June, that when an aspect of one photon's

250
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:58,629
quantum state is measured, the other photon changes in response even when the two photons

251
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:03,809
are separated by large distances. And this would seem to be impossible because it would

252
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,649
seem to violate relativity because it's an instantaneous effect and we know that we can't

253
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:12,139
communicate information faster than light, because if we could do that then we could

254
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:16,159
communicate information back within time and that would cause all kinds of problems with

255
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,820
causality and just be a horrible mess. So these instantaneous effects are supposed to

256
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,739
be impossible but there is one thing that comes to save us and that is this quantum

257
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:33,879
randomness. We don't actually have any control over whether the photon on one side ends up

258
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:38,619
at the upper detector or the lower detector and so we can't actually send information

259
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:43,470
up here to there, we know that if we see the photon up on the upper detector over here,

260
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:49,369
then our counterpart across the universe must have seen it at the lower detector over there

261
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:54,940
but we haven't transmitted any information from A to B. And you can actually prove this

262
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:01,809
mathematically that it's impossible to transmit information using this phenomenon. But it

263
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:11,229
turns out that the proof of the impossibility has a loophole. So that is the end of step

264
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:16,269
one. I'm now going to on the step two and show why the story that I've just told you

265
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:22,649
can't possibly be true. So let's summarize and take stock. A split/combine experiment

266
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:28,659
produces interference. Any which-way measurement destroys that interference, there's some which-way

267
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,539
that the proto measurements that we can go back and erase after the fact and restore

268
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:41,059
the interference and measurements on entangled particles are perfectly anti-correlated. So

269
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:45,759
the quantum conspiracy is that all of these things cannot possibly be true and here's

270
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:53,309
why. So this is a thought experiment. This experiment has not actually been done that,

271
00:25:53,309 --> 00:26:00,879
again, with tongue slightly in cheek, I've done the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Garret paradox,

272
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:08,809
and it's two-slit experiments that are fed by quantum entangled photons produced by one

273
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:12,450
of these down converter setups in the middle, and I want you to consider the question of

274
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:21,440
if we measure on the left, do we destroy the interference on the right? So, if the answer

275
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,519
is yes, then we have faster-than-light communication because this interference is a macroscopic

276
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:31,039
effect. It's really easy to see if you have interference or not. You just look at it with

277
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,979
your eyes. You don't need any kind of delicate detectors or anything so you just measure

278
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:41,739
over here and take measurement away, measure, take the measurement away, and over there

279
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:44,919
on the other side of the universe, this interference pattern will come and go and you can send

280
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,979
Morse code instantaneously. That's obviously impossible, so the answer must be no. But

281
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:56,229
if the answer is no, then we know the position of one particle but we have interference regardless

282
00:26:56,229 --> 00:27:02,700
and that contradicts the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, which is that we can't

283
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:10,489
know the position of the particle and still have it interfere. Now, this is not yet an

284
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:16,049
iron-clad argument. There is one other possibility that I have not mentioned here. Can anybody

285
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:22,960
think of what it is? Any of the physicists in the crowd? Oh, good. So, this one last

286
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,419
possibility, and that is that if there was no interference to begin with. It might be

287
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:33,109
that entanglement sort of counts as one of these subtle proto-measurements that destroys

288
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,700
the interference so we didn't have any interference to begin with. But it turns out that doesn't

289
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,029
get us out of this faster-than-light conundrum because, fine, if that's the case, then we

290
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:46,229
can still produce faster-than-light communications by putting in a quantum eraser and destroy

291
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:49,999
the entanglement. Entanglement is a very--is a very delicate property. Physicists work

292
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:55,169
very hard to produce it and maintain it. It's very easy to destroy. So, just destroy the

293
00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:58,509
entanglement and produce interference where there was none before and, again, we have

294
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:05,700
a faster-than-light signal-ly mechanism. Now, that is a very compelling argument that the

295
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,679
story that I have told you, the usual quantum story is wrong. That argument is, in fact,

296
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,229
correct. The story that I have told up until now is, in fact, wrong, and that's why.

297
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:22,649
>> You said this experiment hasn't been done,
why not?

298
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:27,489
>> GARRET: Because all physicists know what
the outcome will be. And I'm about--I'm about

299
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:31,049
to tell you what the outcome will be. And by the time I finish telling you, you will

300
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:34,090
be convinced enough that the outcome is what I tell you that it will be that you won't

301
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,159
need--feel the need to do the experiment either. I promise you--hmm?

302
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,889
>> GLECKLER: Why don't you repeat the question.
>> GARRET: Oh, I'm sorry. The question was,

303
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,469
why hasn't this experiment been done. Yeah?
>> So the entanglement is about polarization,

304
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:57,139
in which way it goes through a splitter, is that about exactly the same polarization,

305
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:58,359
we know they're the same?
>> GARRET: That's right. So, I assuming here,

306
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:01,929
like I said, there are lots of different ways that you can do the split-combine experiments.

307
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:04,749
You can use some thing called a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. You can use something called

308
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:08,229
a Stern-Gerlach device. You can, you know, lots of different ways. When I talk about

309
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:11,779
polarization, the way that the splitting is done is with the device called the polarizing

310
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:16,629
beam splitter, which is exactly like one of these, except instead of just absorbing half

311
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,889
the photons and letting half the--half of them go through, it reflects them. So it look

312
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:27,759
like a mirror, a half-silvered mirror, and what comes out this direction is photons that

313
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,719
are polarized one direction and what gets reflected at the other direction are photons

314
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:40,080
that are polarized in the opposite direction. Okay, so we are now in the depths of the rabbit

315
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,019
hole and now, it's time to find our way back out. We're going to do some math. Don't panic,

316
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:53,450
it will not be as bad as you think. This is the mathematics of quantum mechanics right

317
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:00,580
here. This is the famous Schrodinger wave equation. It's--this is the free variable

318
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,580
here is this thing called psi. Psi is the quantum wave function and it obeys the dynamics

319
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,109
of this partial differential equation, which those of you who are proficient in partial

320
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:16,049
differential equations, will recognize as a wave equation like any other equation that

321
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:22,330
describes waves, and that's why these particles seem to propagate like wave because this is

322
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:29,619
the map that describes how they propagate. The point here is that these, the dynamics

323
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:37,450
of this thing, are continuous and time-reversible. All wave equations have continuous time-reversible

324
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:43,299
dynamics. And the second part of quantum mechanics is that you take this quantum wave function,

325
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:49,549
which is a function of position and time and is a complex number, you take the norm, the

326
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:53,679
magnitude of that complex number and square it, and that gives you the probability of

327
00:30:53,679 --> 00:31:00,639
measuring a particle at this position X at a time T. That's really all you need to know

328
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:05,379
about the mathematics of quantum mechanics. There are some things to note about this.

329
00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:10,639
There is this distinction between the underlying amplitudes, which are complex numbers, and

330
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:15,219
the probabilities, which are of where we find these particles, which is the only thing that

331
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:21,179
we can measure which are real numbers. And the reason that particles can interfere is

332
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:26,609
because complex numbers with magnitudes greater than zero can add to zero. You can have a

333
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:30,489
complex number that points off in this direction, another complex number that point off in that

334
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:35,080
direction. They always have magnitudes greater than zero but they can add and destructively

335
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,099
interfere. The dynamics are continuous, time-symmetric, fully deterministic and hence, reversible,

336
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,309
and so there's no place where you--there's no place you can find anything that resembles

337
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:55,489
collapse in this math. And no randomness either, by the way. Going from amplitudes to probabilities

338
00:31:55,489 --> 00:32:01,690
by taking this wave function and squaring it has no physical justification or whatsoever.

339
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:09,309
It's purely a hack. But it's a hack that works really, really well. So here's what the actual

340
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:16,509
math looks like for the two-slit experiment. This is, and if you go to actual papers on

341
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:19,249
quantum physics you won't find this in the popular press, this is what you will find

342
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:28,999
in physics journals. This is--or physics texts--this is the state, the amplitude of the photon

343
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:33,489
being at the upper detector. This is the amplitude of photon being at the lower detector and

344
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:37,759
we have to divide by the square root of two in order to make the total probability come

345
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:47,639
out to be one. So to figure out the probability, we take this number, which is a complex number,

346
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:52,599
and take the modules and square it. And when we do that, it's almost exactly the same as

347
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:56,869
just squaring A plus B in 8th grade algebra class, you get A squared plus B squared plus

348
00:32:56,869 --> 00:33:01,159
AB plus BA. You have to take these complex conjugates because they're complex numbers,

349
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:04,629
and the square root of negative one pops in there to do some weird things, those kind

350
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:10,700
of details don't matter. The point is this is a complex number, psi U is a complex number.

351
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:16,009
Its magnitude is a real number and when you square it it's a positive real number. So

352
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:19,289
here we have a positive real number, here we have another positive real number, the

353
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:24,929
sum of those two has to be a positive real number. But over here we have two different

354
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:29,210
complex numbers and two different complex numbers that were multiplied together so this

355
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:35,409
sum can be negative. So this is--this is where the interference comes from. This is the mathematical

356
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:41,719
manifestation of interference in quantum mechanics. That's what it looks like in terms of Greek

357
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:47,889
symbols. So, what happens when we add detectors? Well, when we add detectors, the amplitude

358
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:53,619
starts to look like this. We have the amplitude for the photon to be at the upper detector

359
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:59,210
times the amplitude for the detector to be in the state where it shows that the particle

360
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:04,839
is at the upper detector and the same thing at the lower detector. So this is just the

361
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,700
mathematical description of that. And when you--when you--when you take the amplitude

362
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,830
to that and square it, here's what you get, same thing as before, psi U squared plus psi

363
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:23,070
L squared. And this, which looks an awful lot like an interference term, right, which

364
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,379
is weird because I just got though telling you that if we have a detector that we know--tells

365
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:32,470
us which way the particle went, that destroys the interference. Well, there's this subtle

366
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:37,000
difference here between what we have now-what we have before, and that's this weird notation

367
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,110
here, which is called the rock--bracket notation. You don't need to concern yourself with it.

368
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:48,260
Just take my word for it when I tell you that this quantity here is the amplitude for the

369
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:54,640
detector to spontaneously switch between indicating that the particle is at the upper slit and

370
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,280
the lower slit. In other words, it's a measure of the reliability of the detector. That just

371
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,580
comes out when you do the math. And if the detector is working properly, that value--oops--this--this

372
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:16,820
value is the amplitude for it to spontaneously switch between UNL and spontaneously switch

373
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:24,640
between L and U, those are both zero so this term goes away. That's the math of how measurement

374
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:29,870
destroys probability. And the interesting thing about this is that measurement is a

375
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:34,320
continuum. It's not a dichotomy. The math tells us that we can measure just a little

376
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,850
bit or we can measure mostly but not quite. And we have vary--it's a varying levels of

377
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:47,160
interference that we get depending on whether the measurement that we're making is reliable

378
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:55,300
or not. That's what the math says. So what about entanglement? Well, this is, if you

379
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:01,530
go to a physics paper that talks about entangled particles, this is what you will see as the

380
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,050
mathematical description of a pair of entangled particles. What this means is that you have

381
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:12,260
an amplitude for the particle on the left to be in the up state and the particle on

382
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,250
the right to be in the down state superimposed with an amplitude for the particle on the

383
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,070
left to be in the down state and the particle on the right to be in the up state; again,

384
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:31,840
divided by the square root of two. Now, this looks a lot like the--or the unmeasured two-slit

385
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:37,920
description. But there's some notational sleight of hand going on here because this is shorthand

386
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,090
for this and it's an unfamiliar notation. This vertical bar, followed by the bracket,

387
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,870
this is a term. So you got--this is a quantum wave function here. This is another quantum

388
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:55,750
wave function here. This is the wave function for the upper particle. This is a wave function

389
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:01,420
for the lower particle. Another way to write that is--you don't have to use arrows, that's

390
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,500
just a notational convenience, so I could call this the left upper particle and the

391
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,310
right downward particle, and the left downward particle on the right upper particle. And

392
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:18,980
this is just another way of writing this Psi, this quantum wave function. So this and this

393
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,860
are the same thing in different notations. And this should now look familiar. This is

394
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:34,580
exactly the same as--oops--as this, the two-slit experiment with the detector, module of a

395
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:43,700
few labels. And so, that is now the answer to the first part of the EPRG Paradox. In

396
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,900
fact, entanglement does count as a proto-measurement that destroys interference. But it's actually

397
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:55,580
much deeper that that. According to the math, entanglement and measurement or the exact

398
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:03,650
same phenomenon, the math is exactly the same, and that is why entanglement destroys interference

399
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,400
because entanglement is measurement. And I have a lot more to say about that later in

400
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:15,140
the talk. So okay, so there's no interference but now what about this last--the idea of

401
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,370
creating the interference using a quantum eraser. So let's take another look at our--I'm

402
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:26,820
running little short on time so I'm just going to blast through this. This is what the state

403
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:34,520
equation looks like for the quantum eraser after the so-called measurement but before

404
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,350
erasure. So you have an upper photon that's horizontally polarized because we've--let's

405
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:46,550
assume we start with a vertically polarized light going in here and we measure by rotating

406
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:53,510
90 degrees. So we have now the upper photon rotated from vertical to horizontal and the

407
00:38:53,510 --> 00:39:00,140
lower photon still vertical and this you will now--you should recognize as a measured and

408
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,820
therefore non-interfering state. And it turns out that if you filter now at 45 degrees this

409
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:13,840
is the state function, the quantum wave function, that you end up with. You now have a photon

410
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:19,450
that's either in the upper or lower slit and that's either horizontally or vertically polarized,

411
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:24,540
and this kind of makes sense because if you think of these as vectors and you have a horizontal

412
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,090
polarization plus a vertical polarization, that's a 45-degree polarization, which is

413
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:36,540
exactly what you would expect to see if we're filtering it 45 degrees, right? But remember

414
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,560
the square root of two term here that I told you was there in order to make the total probability

415
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,370
to come out to be one? Now, that's a two root though, and if you run the math on this you

416
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:54,580
find out that the total probability is not one, it's one-half. So either we've made a

417
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:02,240
mistake or half our photons have gone missing. Well, in fact, half our photons have gone

418
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,410
missing which is also shouldn't be too surprising because we filtered--we put this 45-degree--we

419
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:13,700
put this filter in place. This filter is filtering out half the photons that go through it. If

420
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,230
it--if they come in at 45 degrees then half of them come out polarized this way and the

421
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:26,390
other half get blocked. So it turns out that the other half, the half that didn't get through,

422
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,440
have a different wave function that has a negative sign over here, which again, makes

423
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,120
intuitive sense because the filter lets these--the filter is at 45 degrees so it lets this axis

424
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:46,800
through and this axis, which is the H minus V axis it blocks. And these photons interfere

425
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,730
with themselves and these photons also interfere with themselves. So the photons that passed

426
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:58,350
through the filter display interference fringes and the photons that don't pass also display

427
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,460
interference but it turns out that they're anti-fringes. They're exactly like the bright

428
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,340
spots in the interference fringes for the photons that got filtered out, exactly lined

429
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:14,580
up with the dark spots of the fringes for the photons that were let through. And they

430
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,530
sum together to produce what we perceived when we look at it as non-interference. So

431
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,480
this quantum eraser doesn't actually erase anything and it doesn't produce interference,

432
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,560
it just filters out interference that was actually already there all along. And it turns

433
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,590
out that we can actually do this in the EPR experiment too. And the way that we--but in

434
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,660
order to do it, we have to transmit classical information from one side of the other in

435
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:42,240
order to do the filtering. The way it works is you make a record of all the photons that

436
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,660
you collected over here and keep it in order so you've got this record of first photon

437
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,660
was at the upper detector, the second photon was at the down detector, and so on and so

438
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:55,660
forth, and over here you keep track of which photons ended up where on your screen, and

439
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,170
then you take this record and you transmit it over here by some classical slower-than-light

440
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:04,050
channel. And you look at all the up photons and sure enough there's an interference pattern,

441
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,850
and you look at all the down photons and sure enough there's an interference pattern. But

442
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:13,450
the only way to see that is to take classical information and move it from here to here.

443
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:19,690
And that is the last nail in the coffin. I was very disappointed when I learned this

444
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:24,230
10 years ago because I was really counting on winning a Nobel Prize and taking over the

445
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:31,590
world but, oh, well, this is the next best thing. So the take-home message up to this

446
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:39,500
point is measurement and entanglement are the same phenomenon, and what you will find

447
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:45,820
in many, many accounts and even some professional accounts, is that they're completely different.

448
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:50,810
That measurement is this common everyday thing that we can sort of intuitively grasp and

449
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:57,320
entanglement is the quintessential quantum mystery and in fact they are really the exact

450
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:02,510
same thing. Now, having come to that realization we can now tell a different story about quantum

451
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:09,050
mechanics that to my software engineer's mind is much more intuitively pleasing than any

452
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:15,110
of the other competing alternatives. So Copenhagen is the most popular but as we've seen it,

453
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:22,920
it's scientifically untenable. There just is no collapse. Their--the next most popular

454
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,280
interpretation is the so-called "many worlds" interpretation where it says that anytime

455
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:34,630
that a particle can go multiple ways, the entire universe splits and the math actually

456
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:40,280
supports that, but I personally find that that takes a heavier toll on my intuition

457
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,490
than I'm really willing to concede. There's another thing that nobody's ever heard of

458
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,520
called the "transactional" interpretation by fellow named Cramer at the University of

459
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,940
Washington. Actually, if you're really interested in this stuff, I encourage you to take a look

460
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:58,050
at because it is kind of interesting. It postulates that the backwards in time solution for Maxwell's

461
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:03,200
equation are physically real and if you make that assumption then you can explain a lot

462
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,870
of stuff, but I don't have time to get into that. What I want to talk about here is the

463
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:12,260
quantum information theory which I have dubbed the "zero-worlds" interpretation of quantum

464
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:17,700
mechanics. It's an extension of classical information theory with complex numbers and

465
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,550
if you run through that math you get some very interesting results. So here is a lightning

466
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:27,690
introduction to classical information theory. It's the study of this quantity called the

467
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:33,050
Shannon entropy of a system A, which can be in any one of a number of classical states,

468
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:37,370
and it's defined as the sum of the probability that the system is in sum state A times the

469
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:43,040
log of that probability and then you take a negative sign. And intuitively, it's a measure

470
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,860
of the amount of randomness that's in the system A. So just to simplify things for the

471
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,580
purpose of this talk, if the system has an equal probability of being in one of N states,

472
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:59,500
then the entropy is just the log of N. So when N is one and the system is definitely

473
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,410
in one state then the entropy is zero. And if it can be in one of two states with equal

474
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:10,770
probability and we take this log base two, we measure information content in bits, then

475
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:19,550
it has one bit of randomness in it. You can define all kinds of other derived quantities

476
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,770
like the joint entropy of multiple systems and the conditional entropy, and this quantity

477
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:28,140
here which is called the information entropy which is a measure of how much information

478
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,960
a system A contains about a system B, and the interesting thing to note about it is

479
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:41,110
it's the sum of some of these other quantities that had been defined up here. And the information

480
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:46,950
entropy ranges between zero and one, where zero means that this system has no--system

481
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,930
A has no information about system B, they're completely uncorrelated, and one means that

482
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:58,530
they're perfectly correlated. So for example, because they're sums we can describe these

483
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:05,730
quantities as Venn diagrams. So this circle here on the left is system A and this circle

484
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:14,160
on the right is the system B, and the total entropy is contained inside these circles,

485
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,430
the total entropy for each system, and the information entropy is here in the intersection,

486
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:29,000
and that leaves the conditional entropy out here because the information entropy is the

487
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,110
system's individual entropy minus the conditional entropy, just simple addition. This is the

488
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:40,730
important part. If we flip two coins so that they're completely independent of each other,

489
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:47,850
this is what the numbers end up looking like. The conditional entropy, the coin A has one

490
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,910
bit of randomness and coin B has one bit of randomness so the total entropy in the system

491
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:55,970
is two bits of randomness. The system as a whole of these two coins can be in one of

492
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:02,460
four states, the log of four is two, and there's no information that one coin contains about

493
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,710
the other. By way of contrast, if we have a coin with a sensor, just looking at that

494
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:13,760
coin telling us whether it's landed heads or tails then--and the sensor is working properly,

495
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:21,550
then we have one bit of information entropy because the sensor gives us perfect information

496
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,980
about the coin and vice versa by the way. The coin gives us perfect information about

497
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:29,920
the sensor, there's no directionality here, and the total entropy in the system is one

498
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,720
bit so it's only going to be in one of two states, heads and sensor says heads, or tails

499
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:41,080
and sensor says tails. If we extend, do the same math again except using complex numbers

500
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:47,060
instead of real numbers then you end up with something called the Von Neumann entropy which

501
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:54,530
is called S and this hairy-looking equation over here, which I don't have time to go into,

502
00:47:54,530 --> 00:48:00,170
but the intuition is kind of the same as it was before when we talked about how interference

503
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:05,480
was produced. Because we're now dealing with complex numbers rather than real numbers,

504
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,740
the information entropy is no longer restricted to the range zero and one. And, in fact, entropies

505
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:17,470
are no longer restricted to be positive real numbers, they can be negative. And this turns

506
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:24,410
out to be, if you do the math, the entropy diagram for a pair of entangled particles.

507
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:30,980
You get a negative bit of entropy over here. And the information entropy, the amount of

508
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:35,990
information that one particle quantum information now, that one particle contains about the

509
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:42,320
other is two bits. So you can think about two entangled particles, the math is telling

510
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,730
us that these particles are now, somehow, better than perfectly correlated. They have

511
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:53,690
become super correlated and the total entropy of this system, the sum of all these numbers,

512
00:48:53,690 --> 00:49:02,230
is zero. There's no randomness. That's not yet the cool part. What happens when we take

513
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:07,690
a measurement? Well, when we take measurement, we have a particle that becomes entangled

514
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:12,200
with a macroscopic system of particles. So what happens if we have three mutually entangled

515
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:20,490
particles? You end up with a Venn diagram that looks like this and if we assume a two-state

516
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:27,230
system then the actual numbers come out looking like this. You've got one bit of information

517
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,800
entropy between A and C, one bit between A and B, and you've got this negative, this

518
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:41,920
weird negative entropies over here and it's all kind of mind-boggling. But let's imagine

519
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,770
that this particle down here is the one that we're measuring and this is our--these two

520
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,950
particles here are our measurement apparatus. And let's look just at the measurement apparatus

521
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:56,330
and ignore the fact that we're actually measuring a particle here. So we're going to take this

522
00:49:56,330 --> 00:50:02,990
particle C, we're just going to throw it out for a minute. It turns out that ignoring C

523
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:11,210
is exactly what is represented by this trace operator here that ends up showing up in the

524
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:22,660
math. Look what happens. This one bit of information entropy--we lose this boundary so this one,

525
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:27,670
the negative one, cancel out and become a zero, same thing over here, and what we have

526
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:36,350
is if we ignore this is exactly the same system from an information theoretical point of view

527
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:42,410
as a coin with a sensor, we have two classical particles that are perfectly correlated with

528
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:50,450
each other in a classical sense. I should remind you of the experiment that we did at

529
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:58,160
the beginning of the talk where everybody agreed that that's something was green. And

530
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,230
we can get that from quantum mechanics, we get these two systems that are in classical

531
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:06,560
correlation. But we did that not by actual--not by having an objective physical reality that

532
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,840
we reflect but actually by ignoring the thing that we're measuring, or that we think we're

533
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:16,450
measuring. As it turns out that this extends to any macroscopic ecosystem. If you add an

534
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:20,750
arbitrary number of particles the entropy diagram ends up looking exactly the same.

535
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:25,410
So, this is now the mathematical description of a quantum measurement. You have the system

536
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:32,880
that you're measuring. It's particle Q. It interacts and gets entangled with A particle,

537
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,140
which is in the parlance of the theory called an ancilla which is why they label it A, and

538
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:45,070
that ancilla then gets entangled with a macroscopic measurement apparatus in system of 10 to the

539
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:50,730
23 particles, and the entropy diagram ends up looking exactly the same where this entire

540
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:58,420
system has the same quantum information, theoretical information content, as the third particle

541
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:06,070
in a three-particle entangled system. So, that is now a description of what measurement

542
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:09,970
looks like purely in terms of quantum mechanics. And the interesting thing about that is it

543
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:15,400
describes all of the microscopic phenomenon that we see that we naively observe about

544
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,550
classical measurements but it's purely in terms of quantum mechanics, which means that

545
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:29,270
it's reversible. So, their--so, somehow, we ought to be able to undo an actual physical

546
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:35,720
classical measurement but in practice we can't seem to. And the reason for that is because

547
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,930
in order to do that--in theory, it's possible, but in practice we would have to undo all

548
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:46,260
of the entanglements in this macroscopic system. So, for me, to now go back in--back in time,

549
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,230
you know, we aren't really going back in time, but for me to erase all of your memories of

550
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:55,680
having seen this green thing on the screen and agreed that it was green at the beginning

551
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:02,450
of the screen, I would have to undo this enormous web of entanglement that has since proliferated

552
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,410
at the speed of light. I have to bring all those particles back together and recombine

553
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:11,970
them. And in principle, that's possible and in practice, obviously, it's not, which is

554
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:19,520
why classical measurement seems to be irreversible despite the fact that the physics of the universe

555
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,980
say that everything is reversible. So, this has some philosophical implications. I call

556
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:31,120
it the zero universe interpretation of quantum mechanics. If you really--if you buy this

557
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:35,860
as a description of what the physics of the universe is really like, then it tells you

558
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:42,010
unambiguously that it is not the case; that the reason that measurements are consistent

559
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:49,610
across space and time is because there's a real underlying metaphysical reality out there.

560
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:57,960
It tells you in fact, the exact opposite, that what we really are is, as David Mermin

561
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:03,220
puts it, "correlations without correlata." We are not made of atoms we are actually made

562
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:11,580
of bits. We are our thoughts and these thoughts actually reside, if you will forgive stretching

563
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,960
a metaphor to the breaking point, we are a simulation running on a quantum computer.

564
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:25,720
I'm going to skip that. So, the take-home message is, going back to this Einstein quote

565
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,690
that, "The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it's comprehensible."

566
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:33,270
Here's an explanation in terms of physical theory of why the universe is comprehensible.

567
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:39,990
Quantum mechanics actually predicts a comprehensible universe but at the cost of forcing you to

568
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:44,600
believe that what you perceive as physical reality is not actually real it's actually

569
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:54,770
an illusion. And the motto here is that "spooky action at a distance" is no more and no less

570
00:54:54,770 --> 00:55:01,740
mysterious than the "spooky action across time" that lets us perceive the universe as

571
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,520
consistent from one moment to the next. They're both produced by the exact, same physical

572
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:14,190
phenomenon, namely entanglement. And I'll leave you with this quote from an ancient

573
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:27,960
Japanese Zen master and open the floor for questions. Uh-oh, the physicists are walking

574
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:37,170
out. Yeah?
>> So you have the three particles when you

575
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:50,520
remove from the shell what the main two look like and they were building to the point in

576
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:50,660
the sensor. Why not leave the--what happens when you leave a third particle away? And

577
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:56,160
if you're taking that as another thought experiments and say, "Well, this is equivalent too."

578
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,359
>> GARRET: Yeah. Well, this is--so these are
all just math, right?

579
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,690
>> Right.
>> GARRET: So, these are all mathematical

580
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:06,990
manipulations, the results of which we interpret in order to tell stories about what our world

581
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:12,920
is like. And if you leave it in, then what you have is a description of the unadulterated

582
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,310
underlying physical reality, which is quantum. And the reason that's hard to wrap your brain

583
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:24,980
around is because your brain is classical, everything that you are is classical. You're

584
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:30,320
made of classical bits that ones--or you're a Turing machine, you're not a quantum computer,

585
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,580
but you're made out of a quantum computer. And that's why there's this fundamental disconnect

586
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,740
that will always take a toll in our intuitions that will never go away because they're really

587
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:44,020
fundamentally different. The difference between real numbers and complex numbers, the underlying

588
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:49,330
reality is complex, but the thing that is processing the information that lets you think

589
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:55,500
about these things is real. It's made of real numbers. That's really the underlying--the

590
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,960
pithiest way I know of summarizing this so it just depends on what point of view you

591
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:06,790
want to take.
>> I'd like to make a short pitch for the

592
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:14,800
multiple universes and hear your response. The multiple universes, one way to look at

593
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:22,950
it is the natural equation, it allows for--because it's linear, you can have things occurring

594
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:31,950
that live in the same equation and sometimes, say, with the dead and a live cat, you can

595
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:37,210
see that you can actually sort of separate them, each goes its own way, they don't interact

596
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:45,820
much, so a very good approximation is to consider them one at a time. However, when real quantum

597
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:51,970
effects go then you cannot do it this way. So, there are--there are some things that

598
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:58,420
you can separate and some not. So, now, you're saying that you have an interpretation of

599
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,880
a one universe so...
>> GARRET: No, not one. Zero.

600
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,360
>> Zero, all right.
>> GARRET: Very important distinction. One

601
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,849
universe, one classical universe really is untenable.

602
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:10,020
>> Well...
>> GARRET: You can--you can--that's Copenhagen.

603
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,550
>> Yeah.
>> GARRET: You can--you can--yes, the--so

604
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:18,410
the question was, what do I think about multiple universes? Multiple universes are just as

605
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:25,290
tenable, according the math, as zero universes. The only thing that's not tenable is one classical

606
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,710
universe, that's--that's the only thing that the math tells you unambiguously does not

607
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:36,220
exist. And it's a matter of taste. You know, I personally--one of the things that the--that

608
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:42,160
the math tells you if you think about it in terms of multiple universes, is that once

609
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:49,440
you get beyond a certain level of separation these universes are forever inaccessible to

610
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:56,080
us, even, you know, to any reasonable degree of approximation. And then there's this philosophical

611
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:04,560
question of is the thing actually real and the analogy that--the best analogy that I've

612
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:10,770
heard is imagine a photon that leaves the back of the sun and goes away from us and

613
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:21,430
so it's forever outside our light cone, is that photon real? And my reply to that is

614
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,340
there's a difference between the photon that leaves the back of the sun and travels away

615
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:29,290
from us because there's always the possibility that somewhere out there's a mirror that's

616
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:34,650
going to reflect that photon back to us and we won't know that until that mirror actually

617
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:41,770
reflects it and it comes back and we can see. But in the case of multiple universes, we

618
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:45,900
know unambiguously the math tells us so that once another universe splits off, it's never

619
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:51,200
coming back. There's no way to bring it back.
>> After a concurrent time, it will.

620
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,160
>> GARRET: Excuse me?
>> After a concurrent time, it will.

621
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:02,610
>> GARRET: Okay, in any amount of time that
we have any practical reason to care about.

622
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:12,910
So, yes, if you're thinking cosmologically, multiple universes is a--is a tenable interpretation.

623
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:18,650
If you're thinking in terms--if--if you want a story that you can help you to understand

624
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:24,170
how the universe works in terms of your everyday life and what your fundamental nature is,

625
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:30,080
I personally find that I gravitate more towards the information theoretic point of view and

626
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:36,520
believing that--that I'm--I--the universe that I exist in is a very good high-quality

627
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:42,700
simulation. But that's a matter of taste.
>> So do multiple universes conserve mass

628
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:47,050
energy?
>> GARRET: That I don't know. I have to defer

629
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:52,960
that to the physicists. That's a very good question. I don't--I actually don't know the

630
01:00:52,960 --> 01:01:00,280
answer to that.
>> Could you amplify a bit more for what does

631
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,130
a zero universe mean?
>> GARRET: This--oh, by the way, the question

632
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:05,830
back here was do multiple universes conserve mass energy. It's a very--a very good question

633
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:09,420
because--and I don't know the answer. I should--I should ask--I need to ask a physicist who...

634
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:17,790
>> I've asked this question of "many worlds"
proponent and the answer I got is, yes, that

635
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:25,090
you're not actually doubling the amount of mass, you're dividing the amount of mass into

636
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,500
two effectively but...
>> GARRET: Oh, okay. So somebody in the audience

637
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:31,950
is saying that when universes split, the total amount of mass in the universe gets evenly

638
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:36,220
divided between the two universes and I'm guessing that math works out in such a way

639
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:41,180
that if you reduce the amount of mass in a classical universe uniformly by one half,

640
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:45,780
that everything ends up working out the same as it did before. But I'm going to have to

641
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:46,730
think about that.
>> So this is just even one universe does

642
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:47,150
not conserve mass energy with anything. Universes as whole...

643
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:49,869
>> GARRET: Okay.
>> And yet, in one--in the universe we're

644
01:01:49,869 --> 01:01:56,680
in, we don't seem to see this mass dwindling away.

645
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,230
>> But it's, you know, because we're doing
the same...

646
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:04,400
>> GARRET: Yeah. So in that, we are now beyond
the limits of my knowledge of this stuff.

647
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,150
Yeah?
>> For those of us who are intrigued and teased,

648
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:10,340
where can we learn more?
>> GARRET: So, I have paper about this. It's

649
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:20,280
on the web. I highly recommend David Mermin's book, Boojums: All the Way Through, where

650
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:24,040
he doesn't actually talk about this but he talks about the Bell inequality in a very

651
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:30,280
accessible way, which is also--I didn't have time to talk about that but it's very worthwhile

652
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:36,050
knowing about. Or send--send me an email. I can actually put you in touch with the guys

653
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,690
whose research this talk is based on. They're down at Caltech, I think. Yeah?

654
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:41,970
>> So is this an entirely local theory that
all interactions are interacting locally propagating

655
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:54,970
at the speed of light, or is it?
>> GARRET: Well, so this get--so, the question

656
01:02:54,970 --> 01:03:02,619
was is this a local, purely local theory. It's quantum mechanics. And whether quantum

657
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:10,310
mechanics is purely local is the subject of debate. And it depends--it depends on what

658
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:18,160
you mean by purely local. Classically, it's not, and quantum mechanically, it is. You

659
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:29,510
know, I--this sheds no extra light on that question. Okay, I guess, that's it.
